## Np Vs Dp Analysis ##

**NP vs DP analysis:** Richard Hudson's analysis ("Grammar without functional categories", 1998; cf., Steven Abney, "The English Noun Phrase in its Sentential Aspects", MIT dissertation, 1987) is that determiners are pronouns with an optional (or, in some cases, obligatory) noun complement, and that pronouns are merely a kind of noun. This DP analysis is supported by the following observations: (1) In most languages, words acting as determiners may also act as pronouns. This is true for all determiners in Danish and German, and true for most determiners in English (eg, "these", "many", "this", "that", "all") -- the English exceptions ("the", "a", "an") can be analyzed as pronouns with an obligatory noun complement. (2) Historically, most determiners originate from pronouns. (3) In German, adjectives and verbs agree with determiners rather than nouns in terms of strong-weak inflection of adjectives and case marking on determiners and adjectives. Since it is desirable to analyze agreement as local rather than long-distance, this suggests that the determiner should be chosen as the head of the construction. (4) According to our theoretical preference P3, we should prefer analyses where heads precede their dependents, everything else being equal.

The most common counter-argument against the DP analysis is a semantic intuition that the construction should be headed by the common noun rather than the pronoun (ie, "function" words aren't considered important enough to be heads). However, the validity of this intuition is questionable. For example, in partitive constructions like "den gruppe af aber", the "content" noun ("aber") is embedded within a prepositional complement. Similarly, agreement data from quantity nouns like "flaske" ("bottle"), "gruppe" ("group"), etc. seem to indicate that the predicative adjective agrees with the quantity noun rather than the "content" noun, which suggests that the quantity noun governs the "content" noun.

  * den store gruppe er flot/**flotte
  * den store gruppe aber er flot/**flotte
  * den store gruppe af aber er flot/**flotte
  * aber er flotte/**flot

A second objection against our analysis (raised by Daniel Hardt) is that from a semantic point of view, pronouns should act as variables and determiners as quantifiers, but our analysis treats them in the same way. Dynamic Predicate Logic might provide an elegant solution to this problem, because it replaces the general quantifier structure Q(var, restriction, predication) with the quantifier structure Q(var, restriction) and allows subsequent predications to refer to a quantified variable outside its quantifier scope. Intuitively, this means that the meaning of "alle mænd" is ALL(x,men(x)) in DPL instead of λP.ALL(x, men(x), P(x)) as in the Generalized Quantifier Theory for Montagovian semantics. Then the natural DPL analysis is to analyze the pronoun/determiner "all" as ALL(x,R(x)) where the restriction R is provided by the noun complement, if present, or by the default relation "true" in the absence of a noun complement, thus giving the analysis ALL(x,true) for the bare pronoun "alle".
