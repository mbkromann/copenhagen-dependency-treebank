WEB INTERFACE TO CGI:

One process at a time:

	1. DTAG-CGI creates a session key $session, a query and a query
	key $query, and stores the query (if the same query has been
	issued before, it does not store a query but simply links to the
	results); it sends back a HTML page which updates itself every 5
	seconds. DTAG-CGI implements the following commands:
			
		* [search]: send "find" request
		* [show matches]: show matches (text-based)
		* [show graph]: show graph (hyperlink to image)

	2. There are two versions of DTAG running all the time: DTAG-FIND
	and DTAG-show, each handling their own requests.

	3. DTAG (which is running all the time) is constantly looking for
	requests in $sessions; every time it finds one, it renames the
	request as an old request, processes the request, and stores 
	the answer (along with matches and graphs produced by the
	request). DTAG constantly updates the status during processing. 
	
		$sessions/match/$session.$query.dtag: match request
		$sessions/find/$session.$query.dtag: find request
		$sessions/O$session.$query.dtag: old request
		$sessions/A$session.$query: answer
		$sessions/S$session.$query: status
		$sessions/G$session.$query.{tag,ps,pdf}: graph 
		$sessions/M$session.$query: matches
		$sessions/Q$session.$query: search query 
		$sessions/checksums: checksums for request files
