## Obligatory Modifiers ##

#### Obligatory modifiers ####

Sometimes prepositional phrases and adverbials occur in a sentence in such a way that a) one tends to analyse it as a modifier since different types of phrases can occur here, but at the same time b) it is not optional in the way modifiers normally are. We have decided to label these "obligatory modifiers" (edge: obl). Here are some examples:

  * CS+SP: "Det er bedre **end i skolen**" ("It is better than in the school") (15 examples in the corpus)
  * U=+SP: "Det er den samme **som i skolen**" (It is the same as in the scholl") (13 examples in the corpus)
  * SP+SP: "Der sker ikke noget, **førend i syvende måned**" ("Nothing happens until in the seventh month") (5 examples in the corpus)
  * CS+RG: "Hun var stærkere **end nogensinde**" ("She was stronger than ever") (5 examples in the corpus)
  * CS+CS: "De kan bedre lide det, når de får en is, **end når** de får en pose slik" ("They like it better when they have an ice creme, than when they have a bag of sweets") (1 example in the corpus)

Both "end" and "som" are a little bit like gapping constructions: "Det er bedre end i skolen" could be analysed as a short form of "Det er bedre end det er i skolen". In that case the analysis should look like this:

> In spite of the plausibility of this analysis we have decided to let the analysis of "end" and "som" be parallel to the other constructions; but the eliptical character should be kept in mind.
