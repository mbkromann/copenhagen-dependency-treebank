"Text1"		"English"	148	837	"Killer nurse receives four life sentences Hospital nurse Colin Norris was imprisoned for life today for the killing of four of his patients. 32 year old Norris from Glasgow killed the four women in 2002 by giving them large amounts of sleeping medicine. Yesterday, he was found guilty of four counts of murder following a long trial. He was given four life sentences, one for each of the killings. He will have to serve at least 30 years. Police officer Chris Gregg said that Norris had been acting strangely around the hospital. Only the awareness of other hospital staff put a stop to him and to the killings. The police have learned that the motive for the killings was that Norris disliked working with old people. All of his victims were old weak women with heart problems. All of them could be considered a burden to hospital staff."
"Text2"		"English"	139	846	"Families hit with increase in cost of living British families have to cough up an extra £1,300 a year as food and fuel prices soar at their fastest rate in 17 years. Prices in supermarkets have climbed at an alarming rate over the past year. Analysts have warned that prices will increase further still, making it hard for the Bank of England to cut interest rates as it struggles to keep inflation and the economy under control. To make matters worse, escalating prices are racing ahead of salary increases, especially those of nurses and other healthcare professionals, who have suffered from the government’s insistence that those in the public sector have to receive belowinflation salary increases. In addition to fuel and food, electricity bills are also soaring. Five out of the six largest suppliers have increased their customers' bills."
"Text3"		"English"	132	856	"Spielberg shows Beijing red card over Darfur In a gesture sure to rattle the Chinese Government, Steven Spielberg pulled out of the Beijing Olympics to protest against China’s backing for Sudan’s policy in Darfur. His withdrawal comes in the wake of fighting flaring up again in Darfur and is set to embarrass China, which has sought to halt the negative fallout from having close ties to the Sudanese government. China, which has extensive investments in the Sudanese  oil industry, maintains close links with the Government, which includes one minister charged with crimes against humanity by the International Criminal Court in The Hague. Although emphasizing that Khartoum bears the bulk of the responsibility for these ongoing atrocities, Spielberg maintains that the international community, and particularly China, should do more to end the suffering."
"Text4"		"English"	153	923	"American Express recently announced a second round of job cuts. The announcement sent a shiver through the market for bonds backed by credit card debt. The rise in unemployment has spattered a once-profitable business with red ink. As hopes that credit cards would avoid the pain felt in mortgages have dwindled, so has any chance of the industry avoiding a political backlash. This week Congress voted through a bill that would sharply restrict card issuers’ ability to charge punitive fees and raise interest rates. The industry’s claim that the bill will choke off access to credit is a bit rich given its own rush to reduce its unsecured lending. Morgan Stanley expects the big three issuers to post losses in their card businesses this year and next. Little wonder, then, that card issuers feel shell-shocked. When they clamber back into profit, they can expect returns on assets of only one-half of pre-crisis levels."
"Text5"		"English"	149	796	"Say you go to a bank to get a loan. The bank lends you money. Then it packages your loan with a bunch of others into a bond. Investors buy the bond because they like the steady stream of cash that comes from people slowly paying off their debt. This goes on for a long while. Then one day, you need another loan. But this time, there is no money to lend because the global financial system has turned upside down, and the market for securitization - the process of packaging loans into bonds and freeing up cash for more lending - has fallen off a cliff. We’re now suffering a financial Chernobyl, and securitization is radioactive. It enabled us to gorge on money, which is what got us into this mess. The task now is to find the proper role for securitization so that it doesn’t detonate again."
"Text6"		"English"	147	872	"Every time you look around, it seems like companies are trying to hook up. The proposed marriage of Air France-KLM and Delta Air Lines is the latest to make the rounds. But the suitors must first gain the approval of regulators, who are sure to supervise the courtship with care because of the size of the dowry. The path from the altar is strewn with failed corporate marriages. Still, the matchmaking continues apace. British Airways and Spanish carrier Iberia have been wooing one another for the better part of a year. In March, pharmaceutical giants Merck and Plough-Schering announced their intention to wed. Fiat has ambitious plans to merge with Chrysler and the European operations of General Motors to spin off into a new car company. And the on-again, off-again plans of Porsche and Volkswagen to tie the knot have been dominating the business pages for months."
"Text7"		"English"	147	857	"The Bank of England’s home in Threadneedle Street may not look like a hospital but for the past few months it has been acting like one. As the economic downturn became a full-blown collapse late last year, the central bank’s senior consultants donned their white coats and got to work. First they put their scalpel to interest rates, slicing them from 5% in early October to an all-time low of 0.5% in March. Not content with that, they switched at once from scalpel to syringe and started to inject money into the economy by buying assets with freshly created central-bank money. As with the preceding rate cuts, the new treatment has been  administered in big doses. However, a swift return to economic health is highly unlikely after the financial and economic convulsions of the past two years. A prolonged convalescence is the best that can be expected."
"Text8"		"English"	100	667	"Although developing countries are understandably reluctant to compromise their chances of achieving better standards of living for the poor, action on climate change need not threaten economic development. Incentives must be offered to encourage developing countries to go the extra green mile and implement clean technologies, and could also help minimise emissions from deforestation. Some of the most vulnerable countries of the world have contributed the least to climate change, but are bearing the brunt of it. Developing countries, in particular, need to adapt to the effects of climate change. Adaptation and mitigation efforts must therefore go hand in hand."
"Text9"		"Danish"	142	827	"Nogle vil påstå, at mænd og kvinder taler forskellige sprog. Hvis en mand i et parforhold siger, at han ikke ønsker at tale om sine problemer, føler den typiske kvinde, at hun bliver udelukket fra hans verden. Hvis kvinden siger til ham, at hun ikke ønsker at snakke om problemerne, tror de fleste mænd, at hun ikke har behov for at tale om dem. Disse misforståelser giver anledning til skænderier. Når store skænderier opstår, reagerer kvinder og mænd også forskelligt. Ny forskning viser, at mange kvinder græder, når de er vrede. I disse situationer vælger skræmte mænd at flygte, og de kan føle sig hjælpeløse. I modsætning til den grædende kvinde bruger den vrede mand hårde ord. På trods af disse forskellige reaktioner formår de fleste mænd og kvinder at leve fredeligt sammen, og vi kan jo nok ikke leve uden hinanden."
"Text10"		"Danish"	127	838	"I mange hjem finder man et kæledyr, og de fleste mennesker foretrækker enten hund eller kat. Indtil videre slår den bløde hundehvalp den kære killing i kapløbet om at være Danmarks mest populære kæledyr. Mens hundens loyalitet forklarer dens store popularitet, elsker de talrige katteejere kattens selvstændighed. Mens den almindelige katteejer synes, at en hund er for uselvstændig og beskidt, opfatter mange hundeejere katte som dovne og upersonlige. Mange kæledyrsejere vælger et kæledyr, der afspejler deres egen personlighed. Når den store stærke mand køber en stor stærk hund, forstærker hundens træk hundeejerens ego. Omvendt foretrækker den feminine kvinde tit den smukke og elegante kat. Hunden og katten enes normalt uden problemer, hvis de er vant til hinanden. Ofte toppes hundeejeren og katteejeren mere end hunden og katten."
"Text11"		"Danish"	107	628	"Utroligt som de ligner hinanden. Sådan tænker mange om Danmarks to prinsesser. Der er mange ligheder mellem Mary og Marie, men ligeså mange, hvis ikke flere forskelligheder. De kommer begge fra udlandet, er borgerlig fødte og har fundet sammen med hver deres prins af Danmark - Mary er gift med kronprins Frederik og Marie med prins Joachim. Også navn og udseendet minder utroligt meget om hinanden. Begge er modelsmukke med langt, mørkt hår og store, brune øjne. Men trods de mange ligheder er Mary og Marie også to selvstændige individer, der har levet og lever på hver deres måde, og som har præget deres værdier og karakter."
"Text12"		"English"	186	1145	"Crumpling a sheet of paper seems simple and doesn't require much effort, but explaining the crumpled ball’s behavior is another matter entirely. Once a paper ball is scrunched, it is more than 75 percent air. Yet it displays surprising strength and resists further compression, a fact that has confounded physicists. A report in Physical Review Letters, though, describes one aspect of the behavior of crumpled sheets: changes in their size in relation to the force they withstand. A crushed thin sheet is essentially a mass of conical points connected by curved ridges, which store energy. In the event of further compression of the sheet these ridges collapse and smaller ones form, increasing the amount of stored energy within the wad. Scientists at the University of Chicago modeled the relation between compression force and ball size. The researchers crumpled a sheet of thin aluminized Mylar and then placed it inside a cylinder equipped with a piston to crush the sheet. Instead of collapsing to a final fixed size, the height of the crushed ball continued to decrease, even three weeks after the researchers had applied the weight."

"Text17"		"English"	237	1691	"Pulmonary hypertension (PHT) is a common complication in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), with a reported prevalence of approximately 30%.[1-4] Multiple studies have shown that PHT is associated with increased mortality in SCD patients.[2, 4-7] The pathogenesis of PHT in SCD is probably due to a variety of factors. Recent evidence suggests a central role for chronic intravascular hemolysis, with associated scavenging of nitric oxide by cell-free plasma hemoglobin.[4,8,9] Arginase, which converts L-arginine (the substrate for nitric oxide synthesis) to ornithine, is also released following hemolysis.[10] Elevated arginase activity, and the resultant decrease in the arginine/ornithine ratio, is associated with PHT in SCD.[4,11] Although various studies have found no association between PHT and a history of acute chest syndrome,[3,4] chronic lung injury resulting from repeated episodes of acute chest syndrome may lead to the development of PHT due to chronic fibrotic pulmonary parenchymal damage, altered vascular tone, vascular proliferation, hypoxia and consequent pulmonary vasculopathy. Finally, pulmonary thromboembolism[12, 13] and progressive endothelial damage with concentric pulmonary vascular intimal hyperplasia and “in situ” thrombosis[13,14] may also contribute to the pathogenesis of PHT in SCD. The aim of the present study was to determine whether coagulation activation and inflammation are associated with PHT in SCD. Furthermore, we aimed to assess correlations between measures of coagulation activation and inflammation with markers of hemolysis. To address these questions, we evaluated a cohort of patients followed at an adult Sickle Cell Clinic."
"Text18"		"English"	121	791	"Sociology is a relatively new academic discipline. It emerged in the early 19th century in response to the challenges of modernity. Increasing mobility and technological advances resulted in the increasing exposure of people to cultures and societies different from their own. The impact of this exposure was varied, but for some people included the breakdown of traditional norms and customs and warranted a revised understanding of how the world works. Sociologists responded to these changes by trying to understand what holds social groups together and also exploring possible solutions to the breakdown of social solidarity. The term sociology was coined by Auguste Comte (1798-1857) in 1838 from the Latin term socius (companion, associate) and the Greek term logia (study of, speech)."
"Text19"		"English"	112	779	"The majority of hunter-gatherer societies are nomadic. It is difficult to be settled under such a subsistence system as the resources of one region can quickly become exhausted. Hunter-gatherer societies also tend to have very low population densities as a result of their subsistence system. Agricultural subsistence systems can support population densities 60 to 100 times greater than land left uncultivated, resulting in denser populations. Hunter-gatherer societies also tend to have non-hierarchical social structures, though this is not always the case. Because hunter-gatherers tend to be nomadic, they generally do not have the possibility to store surplus food. As a result, full-time leaders, bureaucrats, or artisans are rarely supported by hunter-gatherer societies."
