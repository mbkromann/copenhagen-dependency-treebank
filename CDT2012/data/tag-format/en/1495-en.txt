The crisis-ridden major club will, of course, escape more Interbank, but Brøndby must still bear the brunt of yet another beating ?!

Today, B.T. can lift the veil on one of the other big "Lego blocks" in the crisis plan, which despite promises to the contrary will remain under wraps over the weekend.

The situation is that the Brøndby IF in this crisis summer has built up a considerable debt, to put it mildly, in millions of crowns to its bank connections, Unibank and Den Danske Bank.

According to confidential information to B.T., Brøndby's current debt to one of the banks will border on DKK 20 million, while the other will have a lower but nevertheless significant amount in the millions owing from the blue-yellow ex-championship club.

NEW SHARES 

The two major banks belong, incidentally, to Brøndby's highest stratum of sponsors: Unibank as Eurosponsor and Den Danske Bank as a member of the so-called "Exclusive Club".

Both banks' financial "commitment" to Brøndby is at present so exclusive that they both - by virtue of bankruptcy petitions - could in practice have kicked Brøndby far out of Danish top football.
