It is people power consisting of so many individual crosses that collectively decides and thereby exercises authority.  That is the democratic ideal, but I really think most voters - apart from Uffe Ellemann - feel powerless when this cross is to be made and particularly done in connection with the EC vote.  Because who understands the Maastricht agreements and what consequences a no actually has?  Or, respectively, a yes?  No one can properly answer this, so your hand shakes a bit when you pick up your pencil and the responsibility for this historic development has boiled down to a piddling cross on a ballot.

The democratic ideal presumes that the voters en bloc direct the course of history and progress.  It sounds powerful and, hence, the Danish flag is raised at most voting places.  If the voters are still overcome by a sense of powerlessness, it is a feeling that it is history and progress that are directing us, and the cross therefore becomes a bit illusory - because it is more a reaction to something than a decision about something.
