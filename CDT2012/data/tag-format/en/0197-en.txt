That is some very happy news.  But why must I as a politician get it from the press, said the woman who instigated the recent debate on the value of heart transplants, when Berlingske Tidende yesterday read a new report to her.

The report, which covers the 27 heart transplants at the Danish National Hospital from September 1, 1990 to a year later, is just what Conny Dideriksen (S) as chairperson for the board of health for Frederiksborg Country's has asked the Ministry of Health to provide.  With no success, and she was surprised that it had now come directly from the Danish National Hospital to the press.

Before the operation, all the patients had an expected lifetime of under a year.  They were from 10 to 55 years old with an average age of 44.

The majority of them were skilled and unskilled workers.  Four died within a year after the operation, but the others were already much better than before, relates the senior residing physician Jan Aldershvile from the medical heart ward of the Danish National Hospital.

He was, along with social worker Gerda Kirchhoff, behind the study of the 23 surviving patients (20 men and three women).
