Upturn for boating equipment 

The export of motorboats has also grown but relatively little - from DKK 44 million to DKK 50 million.

And, so, the turnover in equipment must come into the picture.  For years, people have loosely estimated this export, which cannot be derived in detail from Statistics Denmark, to be at a value roughly equal to the export of boats, but the chairman of the Danish Boating Industry Association, director John Christensen, who himself with John Mast is quite prominent, believes that the export of equipment - stretching from masts and sails to capstans and instruments to marine windows and sailing clothes - has now reached an extent that exceeds the export of boats.

On the import side, the number of large sailboats has certainly increased, indeed almost doubled in number to 42 against 23 for the same period last year, but the value has almost halved from DKK 20 million to just under DKK 11 million.  Motorboats show almost unchanged numbers, but the value is falling, from DKK 39 million to DKK 28 million.
