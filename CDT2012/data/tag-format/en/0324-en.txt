The popular wisdom in its powerlessness knows something about it.  Around Nordkalotten as around the Equator.  One place they say: "Envy devours its master like rust devours iron", another place: "If envy is a fever, the whole world would be sick".  One place, it is put: "The envious die, but envy never dies", another place: "The envious gnaws at others, but wounds himself".


Worse each time it happens is what happens every single day: That God's name is hitched to the wagon of men, because my will and my happiness must also be God's.


This happens at Nordkalotten.  It happens at the Equator.


Perhaps, it was something of this sort P.G. Lindhardt had in mind, when some years ago he wrote of the bishop election in Copenhagen in 1934, writing of "an election campaign that seeks its equal in intrigue and perfidy".


But that is so long ago.  It is three whole Copenhagen bishop elections ago.
