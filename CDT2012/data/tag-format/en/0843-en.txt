Pio's first appearance in 1871 was directly caused by the great Communard uprising in Paris that same year.  All over Europe, the uprising aroused enthusiasm among the workers and terror among the authorities.  Copenhagen journeymen, oppressed by the free competition after the abolition of serfdom, were eager participants in Pio's movement and the conservative government was just as eager to crush this uprising at birth. 

The story of Pio's agitationally-gifted but organizationally utterly amateurish conduct and the Minister for Justice's cynical exploitation of every chance to crush the movement is a sad story, just as compromising for Pio and especially for his close associates, Geleff and Brix, as for the Danish police and judicial system.

The question is how much the Pio episode of 1871-77 deserves attention in Danish labor history.  Professor Jens Engberg has since 1973 devoted himself to labor history in general and the Pio case in particular.  He deserves great commendation for his biography of Pio from 1979 but has not stopped with this.  He wanted to make public all the sources for the story of the socialist leader's martyrdom.
