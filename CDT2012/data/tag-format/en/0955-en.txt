Art and artistic creation deal with oppositions and their fruitful interaction.  The harmony-seeking, in order not become monotonous, must contain a certain degree of discord and, in even the most spontaneous display, there must be a minimum of structure.

Robert Jacobsen possesses the talent for this life-giving exchange, as to which you can be convinced at the exhibition that his friend Ivan Edeling is holding at his gallery.  The two have worked together since 1950.  Robert has been faithful, when it came to graphics.  Edeling and Robert developed, particularly in the 1970s, a series of new printing techniques with which, in a completely new way, one could maintain the metal's materiality in the graphic print.  Robert Jacobsen welded and fixed plates together.  They were etched and printed deeply.  Colours had really always been in Robert's universe.  Just look at "Wood Personage", which goes back to 1937.  It is, thought-provokingly enough, placed right beside the artist's three most recent lithographs - three colourful and very spontaneous "Dream Pictures".
