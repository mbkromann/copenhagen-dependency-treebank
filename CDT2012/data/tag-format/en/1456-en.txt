- The last paragraph in the article ("As a curiosity it may be mentioned ?") is a downright quote out of context: 

In the annual accounts for Danbyg Totalenterprise A/S, it is stated, "The difficult domestic and international market conditions that have characterized 1991 are also expected to influence the company's earnings in 1992 in Denmark as well as England."  Nowhere, neither in the financial statement nor in the press release, are there expressed expectations for "general growth in the real estate market for the coming year."

All these things were disclosed at the press conference held on Monday, the 17th of this month, and if B.T. had participated in that conference or looked through the other reports of the meeting in the daily press yesterday, the quite misleading conclusions in their above-referenced article could have been avoided.

The whole form and content of the article is of such character that we must express our regret that the periodical publishes such a tendentious report on the basis of factual error, which could have been avoided either by participation at the previously mentioned press conference or by contacting the company or the company's auditor.  Ulrik SÃ¸rensen, Finance Director, Danbyg Totalentreprise A/S.
