And so, it is Mozart year this year.  The Art Gallery is marking the jubilee with a 90 cm high bronze figure of the composer as a boy, assessed at DKK 50,000.  The sculpture is signed by Louis Ernest Barrias, and Glyptoteket has a similar one in marble.  Not much floor space.  Even though the Art Gallery recently moved to a more spacious location on Gothersgade, there is still not much floor space to stray around - this places a natural limit on the array of furniture.  So what is here is a sparse but beautiful.  For example, a couple of Danish Rococo bureaus in Mathias Ortmann's style.  One, in walnut with serpentine sides and front, is assessed at DKK 35,000, among other things, because the underside is of a more recent date.  The other bureau is not quite so heavily restored.  It is also in walnut, ligekn√¶kket, and priced at DKK 60,000.

Woodcuts, applied art and paper cutouts from Japan take up almost an entire long wall.  The many things from Japan come from the recently deceased Poul Holm Olsen, who was a collector, sculptor and associate professor at the Royal Academy of Fine Art.  The assessments of the woodcuts span from DKK 500 for an unsigned one to 4,000 for a work by Toyokuni VI.
