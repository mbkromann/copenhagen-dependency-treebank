Previous experiences with the UTB program indicate that a single educational opportunity of a shorter duration - for example, 13 weeks - will seldom provide sufficient qualifications to lead to jobs for the unemployed.  In addition, an unmet need for training places in connection with educational opportunities has been ascertained.


In many jobs in the public as well as the private sector, it will not be possible to provide employees time off to participate in continuing education, unless replacement workers are hired during the course period.


For this reason, among others, a desire has arisen to have the option of combining VUS with UTB and ATB - also, because the target groups for these programs have, to a large extent, the same (weak) educational background.


The possibility for a combination arises, if an ATB/UTB person is hired for a job made available, when an employee participates in VUS training.  


At the same time, this will allow for an expansion of the number of UTB training places and ATB jobs, even as the long-time unemployed will thereby have an opportunity to do real jobs instead of traditional ATB jobs, which often bear the mark of routine tasks.
