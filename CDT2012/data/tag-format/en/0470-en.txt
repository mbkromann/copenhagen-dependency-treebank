What constitutes poor blood circulation in the legs?  What does it come from - and can you do anything to get the blood to circulate more quickly?


If the arteries are calcified, blood cannot convey sufficient oxygen and nutrition to the muscles and skin.  And so you get cold feet without a pulse, loss of sensation, and poor healing of wounds.

The veins can also have difficulty taking the blood back to the heart and, in that case, blood accumulates and the legs swell.  Result: Sensitive and tired legs and often nightly discomfort and cramps.

There are several possible treatments.  Large, calcified vessels can be widened, by leading a balloon down into them and blowing it up in the narrow places.  But most often, vascular surgeons will replace an old, destroyed artery with an artificial one.

Poor veins with varicose veins can be treated with support hose, so that the veins are pushed together, and the blood does not accumulate.  But it is best to remove poor veins, so blood can run through the deep leg veins, which as a rule function normally.
