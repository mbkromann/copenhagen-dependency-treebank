At first, she just laughed a little and treated it as a joke.  But still.  The next times she had looked at him.  "Finally, I thought that her pregnancy had made her compliant.  That she'd put up with anything.  And I went way too far."  Eva asked him to disappear for good.  Several times before the birth, he had tried to re-establish contact.  Despair consumed him, and a bad conscience, but particularly despair.  It might be that he was the father anyway.  Eva rejected him with a calm that he had never before experienced in her.  He was used to the fact that they could quarrel but had always reconciled.  Something was always happening, and then they were together again, but not this time.  "Eva just sat there, kind and very pregnant, beaming with life and joy and told me that it was over.  Definitively!"

"Did you say to her that you no longer suspected her of having another man, who was the father?" I asked.
