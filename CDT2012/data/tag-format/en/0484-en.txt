Opening bid: DD CL.

There was a full program in the divisions over the weekend - see the summary in Monday's sports extra.  Today, we shall look at a game from a local showdown in Jutland between, on one hand, Steen Schou of Århus with Anker Pabst, H. C. Nielsen and Knud-Aage Boesgaard and, on the other hand, Frederik Mørk of Vejle with Torben Stetkær, Erik Brok and Otto Dahl.  The game ended 18-12 to Mørk.

After 1 CL from Pabst, Stetkær bid 2 HT, a special convention showing an opening hand with at least 5-4 in the major suits.  After East's preference pass, North doubled, confirming thereby a strong opening hand.  Schou, in South, responded with 3 CL, which according to the pair's contracts, promises certain values (a completely flat hand is shown with an artificial 2 UT).  North aggressively encouraged game, showing with 3 SP a good fit.  A 3 UT bid was thereby forced on South.
