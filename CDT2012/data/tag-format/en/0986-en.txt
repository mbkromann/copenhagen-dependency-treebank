The European steel factories find themselves in the middle of the worst downturn in ten years, without prospects for improvement this year.  But it is time to buy stocks in the steel industry, say business analysts.  The steel factories were among those hardest hit by the recession in 1991 and, after a short period with rising demand for stocks in the steel industry at the beginning of the year, the prices have now fallen again the last couple of months.

This will make the shares into a natural object of attraction just as soon as investors see more light in Europe's economy in 1993, say business analysts.  The three favourites are British Steel Plc, the German Thyssen AG and the Swedish SSAB Svenskt St√•l AB.

"Investors may become more enthusiastic about the steel industry long before a recovery appears," wrote Edward Hadas, who is an analyst of the European steel industry at Morgan Stanley International in London, recently in a remark about British Steel.  "There need not be much more than just the tiniest glint of hope of an impending improvement."
