Prioritisation, derived from the French, meaning preference, is, as experience shows, an unknown or rarely used word in Copenhagen city government.

Let me just mention a couple of examples from daily life, Strædet and the modernisation of the laundry at Bispebjerg Hospital.

Strædet, which is located in Snares Kvarter, will be getting a new and very expensive surfacing, the so-called Chaussé bridge surfacing, which consists of square granite paving stones with a space between each stone and very difficult to walk on in every sort of footwear.

For the sake of thoroughness, it must just be mentioned that the street under discussion is a pedestrian street, primarily visited by people who have an interest in antiques, that is, a very limited clientele.  I visited Strædet one morning around 11 o'clock and saw three people on Strædet !

A walk through Fiolstræde, which along with Strøget, among others, is one of Copenhagen's most trafficked streets by pedestrians, revealed that the surfacing was full of holes and uneven and must be deemed directly dangerous to life and limb for elderly and vision-impaired people.  This is true for several other streets in a gradually decayed, worn-out and dirty Copenhagen.
