Kampangpetch, where the dance troupe comes from, is also called the "banana land."  Big bananas grow there, which are said to be the best tasting in all of Thailand.  At the local teachers' college, they created a dance that shows how the peasants grow bananas and harvest them.

The dance troupe has the banana dance as part of the program, where "Between-Us" readers can also look forward to the religious drum dance or a staging of the tradition in Kamphaengphet in which people sacrifice yellow robes to monks on the night in November, when there is a full moon.
