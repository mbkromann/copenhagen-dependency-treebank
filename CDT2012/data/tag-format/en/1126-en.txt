The main message in the annual report of the Savings Bank Association was that bank employees were inefficient in relation to their foreign colleagues.  The Danish banks received poor grades, when it came to cost-effectiveness and core earnings per employee.

For Bastrup, the message of the Savings Bank Association is an expression of the logic of economy of scale.

"That is not what we need to concentrate on," he says.

Thus, it is not expected that Poul Erik Bastrup at the provincial bank association's annual meeting on September 17 will support the tidings of the Savings Bank Association.

The chairman and bank director for Salling Bank, Poul Erik Bastrup, on the other hand, would rather use the day to talk about how local efforts are paying off.

"If we always walk in the footprints of others, we will never get ahead," says Poul Erik Bastrup.
