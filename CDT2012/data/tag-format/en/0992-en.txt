"Ladies and Gentlemen, Michael Jackson has left the stadium!"

The same sentence that resounded when Elvis had left the stage after a Las Vegas show.  At that time, it was called a "building" instead of a "stadium."  But rock has irresistibly expanded its commercial capacity since then.  And Michael Jackson is the ultimate proof.

The operations 

After five years, Michael Jackson is back in Europe.

The most lonesome man in the world, as it is said, is being admired once again by the masses.  With the largest staging for a pop concert ever.

At random may be mentioned 1252 tons of lighting, sound and stage equipment, flown to Europe in two Boeing 747 cargo planes, two tons of stage costumes divided into two big rigs - of which there are a total of 65 with which to freight the gear around the continent - two large generators, strong enough to be able to supply a Danish municipality with electricity, as well as a whole slew of henchmen.

All of it is standing ready for Michael Jackson at Gentofte Stadium on Monday evening.

The first and, perhaps, the only time he will land in Copenhagen.  And for a show that will multiply the mystique around this singer and venerate his untouchability.
