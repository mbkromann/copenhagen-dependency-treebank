If the Conservatives are to propose a serious alternative to the public school system we have today, they must profile their position and make concrete why they, for example, believe that education divided into levels is better.  The various abilities of children are considered quite excellent in the Danish comprehensive school system.  It is here, after all, that they must learn to deal with each other and to take consideration of different frames of reference.  Even particularly gifted children have to live in the society we have, they cannot always opt out.  They must learn to accept differences without delimiting it.  This is done best in a comprehensive school system with differentiated education.  This is to say, education that considers the needs of the individual in the class, along with his comrades.

I lack an answer to what it is Jens JÃ¸rgensen believes is being assessed uniformly nationwide.  My critique of the grading system raised a question as to what specific things were really being assessed in giving grades.
