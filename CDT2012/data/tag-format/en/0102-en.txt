Throughout generations, it has been pounded into our heads that something is art, serious music and culture - and something else is not.  It would unquestionably have been better if we had learned that culture has many facets, stretching from meeting halls to the great theatres.  If we had learned to value ourselves and each other as human beings who need books, magazines, classical music, pop, "Orientation" and "You Call, We Play".  Because none of us are intellectual animals twenty-four hours a day.  We all need also to relax and play, if we are to continue to be whole people. 

Nevertheless, people fight tooth and nail to get the opinion-makers to take "the light" seriously and treat it as a totally valid part of our programming.  That is too bad.

The time has long been due that speaking and writing about entertainment as an important part of our common contemporary culture, and prejudice-free assessment of whether it is professionally and honestly executed.
