In the fall of 1984, Helle was finished with her vocational school but could not get an apprentice job in the grocery business and, at her former workplace as a relief worker in a kiosk, they could not afford an adult relief worker at some DKK 30 an hour.

-  So I started in for myself.  She got a friend to go along with the idea and found a shut-down kiosk in Østerbro in Copenhagen.  On January 1 of this year, Helle's grocery store opened.

-  Of course, I was excited and nervous about getting a huge debt.  On the other hand, I was willing to do anything to avoid unemployment.

Three months later, the turnover was several times greater than expected, and there was money for a new shop.

-  And in the middle of July, I opened the business at the camping site on Havnsø Beach.

It does not look like much, and space is cramped.  On the other hand, every centimetre is exploited, so customers can get the goods they need.  The back room is empty at the moment, but Helle has plans.
