Eddie Carbone, Italian-American dock worker in New York.  A big, hefty guy.  Na√Øve, primitive, uncomplicated feelings.

Feelings that he cannot control and which therefore drive him into a situation in which he acts like a traitor, informer, snitch.  A crime - not in a legal but in a moral sense.  And he pays for it with his life.  

Arthur Miller's play "A View from the Bridge" is a modern passion play.  The passion in Eddie Carbone's case has to do with the niece who has grown up with him like a daughter.  And like so many fathers, he cannot stand that his daughter "deserts" him to marry the man she loves.

The man is his wife's cousin, an illegal Italian immigrant.  Together with his older brother, he has sought shelter with the Carbone family.  And in order to thwart the daughter's marriage, Eddie reports the two refugees to the police.  It is this action the big brother believes he must avenge.  A drama - a duel - that ends in death.
