"Our dog, a labrador, was fed well.  So was the neighbor's large black dog," says Copenhagen Police Commissioner, Poul Eefsen, with a gallows humor to B.T. after a large jewellery heist at his Holte villa and a series of similar heists in the area.

On the evening of Tuesday, March 3, a presumably professional Yugoslavian gang plundered a series of fashionable properties, while the residents were out.  

Their guard dogs were pacified with juicy chunks of meat, so that the two presumed perpetrators could walk around unrestricted, break into drawers and closets, and escape with great valuables.

Police Commissioner Poul Eefsen:

"I don't want a big fuss made out of this case.  I don't want attention called to myself, because it is just as bad for all the other burglary victims in the area."

During the six-seven villa break-ins, an amount totaling a large six figure sum was stolen.  The heist from the Police Commissioner's villa, SÃ¸terrassen 7, Holte, alone provided a haul of DKK 155,000.

Among the curiosities from the heist at the Police Commissioner's was especially a couple of antique candelabras, which alone are assessed at DKK 50,000.  On reporting it to his insurance company, Poul Eefsen reported the amount stolen as a total of DKK 155,000.
