The German Transall plane taxis in to the stand - we are going with it a half an hour later.  Out of the plane jumps a young woman, short-haired, jeans, small sandals, in her late twenties.

She was on a lightning tour of the besieged capital and will return home with the plane.

Anyone who has tried to conduct a conversation in the cargo hold of a dumpling of a plane like this knows the conditions.  The plane is only scantily insulated.  This is the military - this here - not business-class.

Half-shouting, she asks what I think about the war in Bosnia.  I answer that all the parties have blood on their hands - and that you should be wary of taking sides.  But that it seems as if Croatia and Serbia are about the divide the country between them.

Without a thought for the large Muslim population.

"You don't know the Muslims.  It is fantastic.  They lie right to your face, even though it is obvious they're doing it.  It is as if it is a part of their culture."
