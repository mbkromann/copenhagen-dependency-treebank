 
(3 stars) "Karl's Wagon".  Danish.  Premiere in 10 cinemas throughout the country.

"STEADY" means funny in Swedish.  It is one of those words our Danish hero gets into trouble with in "Karl's Wagon", which, however, is neither one nor the other: steady enough or funny enough.

SOMETIMES it is so drawn-out that it almost stops altogether.  Other times, it is so busy saying things that you become incredibly confused.

THE PARTNERSHIP between Danish film director Birger Larsen and Swedish author Ulf Stark, began with "Let the Polar Bears Dance" - it provided a Bodil for best Danish film in 1990.  Now, it continues with "Karla's Wagon," as Ulf Stark's children's book is called in Swedish, where there is a word play in the fact that a girl's name is hidden in the constellation.  With its translation into "Karl's Wagon," a part of the magic is lost.  And so, too, is the film: the stardust of enchantment is blown away in banana smoke!
