Yes and no.  Women in recent years have cast their eyes on hunks like the actors Patrick Swayze ("Ghost" and "Point Break"), Richard Gere (" Pretty Woman") and Kevin Costner ("Dances with Wolves", "JFK") - all of whom look like nice boys with a handle on things.  Their bodies at any rate are far from the '80s' beefcakes Sylvester "Rambo" Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger.
