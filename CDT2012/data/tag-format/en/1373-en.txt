Two RS's

Ford has already made another and smaller rocket, the Escort RS 2000 with 150 hp.  Both engines are 4-cylinder with water-cooled 2 litre twin cam engines with 16 ventilated cylinder heads; but, whereas the "little" RSs have a transverse engine, the temperamental version with Cosworth cylinder heads has the engine lengthwise.

While the RS 2000 has a quadratic engine, that is, equally large cylinder bores and piston strokes, the Cosworth engine is over-quadratic, cylinder bores are somewhat larger than the piston stroke, and then it is equipped with a Garrett turbocharger and intercooler.  That is why there is so much more noise on the permanent 4-wheel drive with a power distribution of 34:66 front and back.  Both cars are equipped with Ford's own 5-step MTX75 gearbox.

The difference between the two cars, apart from the horrible "Dutch extension" behind the Cosworth, the transmission and certain equipment details is that the RS 2000 has a flatter moment curve than the rally rocket, which has to be kicked up in rotations in order to get the full 227 horsepower to work.
