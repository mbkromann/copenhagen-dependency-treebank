Physical therapy, which strives to make the individual patient as independent as possible of others' help, is an important form of treatment.  Stiffness and muscle atrophy is combated, gait control is increased and training programmes can improve the patients' condition.  Riding and swimming - under the control of physical therapists - prove in many instances also to have a good effect on sclerosis victims.

Ergotherapy is likewise a part of patient treatment and, in Haslev and Ry, a great effort is being made to employ sclerosis victims with meaningful work - often with a positive effect as a consequence.

To the extent the means allow it, the Danish Multiple Sclerosis Society also arranges group trips and provides supplements for vacations abroad for sclerosis patients.  Sun and bathing in areas with warmer and drier climate conditions than ours have proved to have a beneficial effect.  Nurses and helpers go along during trips and stays abroad.  The sclerosis victims often have psychic, social and financial problems.  The Multiple Sclerosis Society is constructed in such a way that it can offer assistance in these areas either through its own institutions or the county.
