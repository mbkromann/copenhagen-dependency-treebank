I think it is far too simple and too smartass to put all the blame on Richard MÃ¸ller Nielsen.

He is not the one playing the games.

The truth is - of course - that we do not have at our disposal the same playing staff as in the Eighties.

In addition, Ricardo has the problem that, in three test matches in the spring, he did not have at his disposal the Olympic players from the U-21 team.

The success of the future people is blocking an obvious opportunity to take new roads and try new players before the fall WC matches.

NO WC TICKET

What we saw in Ankara portends no WC ticket for Denmark in the US in two years.

We lost to a mediocre national team that has taken loads of beatings the last two years.

The game revealed with x-ray vision how important Peter Schmeichel, Flemming Povlsen, Kim Vilfort and Kim Christofte are for Denmark.

Only Henrik Andersen came out with an unblemished calling card.

He provided fresh offensive drives, he dared and could do something.
