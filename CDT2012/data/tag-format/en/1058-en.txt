All directors of social services have since the ratification of the law comforted us with the fact that only every tenth household is hit by it.  But undeniably, that is very little comfort for the ten percent who are to pay, and it is generally acknowledged that the law is quite meaningless in an economic respect.

People have also been comforted by SF with the fact that the amount plus interest can be frozen as debt to the municipality in the family's free-standing house, as it can with property taxes.

But the gradual confiscation of the life's work of diligent and thrifty people is quite distasteful.

They are ideas people have even abandoned in the birthplace of communism.

If society only gains a little with this law, the old and the handicapped lose so much more.  For like an extra rose in the buttonhole, they have determined that the maximum payment for home help cannot exceed DKK 1,500 per month and that payment for home help is dependent on how many hours are put in and whether it is a matter of cleaning or personal care.
