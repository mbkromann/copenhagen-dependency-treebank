Later, he had picked up the idea again and recorded Lennon/McCartney's "She Came In Through The Bathroom Window" and "You've Got To Hide Your Love 
Away", which are included on "Night Calls," the 17th album he has put out in his almost 25 years in the record industry.

Joe Cocker did not really get the big push in his career until 1982, when he received a Grammy for his part in "best duet".  The duet was a love theme, "Up Where We Belong" from the film "An Officer & A Gentleman", and he sang it together with Jennifer 
Warnes.

This resulted in Joe Cocker receiving more offers to provide songs for films.  Among them, a rather audacious film, "9Â½ Weeks."  His contribution to this eminent and notorious film was almost as audacious as the film itself.  "You Can Leave Your Hat On" it was called.  Today, you can find him on six film soundtracks.
