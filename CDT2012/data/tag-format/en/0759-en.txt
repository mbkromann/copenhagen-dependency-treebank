Unforgettable - is called the Grammy-winning duet between Natalie Cole and her father, Nat King Cole, who left this world 27 years ago.  At first, it was this technical refinement of a hit, many had looked forward to as the evening's unforgettable culmination.  But there was actually ample opportunity to forget it.

Because before we had gotten that far, we had been introduced to an unusually beautiful and integrated musical show.  In a time in which popular music is more and more about energy and about sound, and where each artist tends to his or her own repertory preserves, it was liberating and fascinating to have opened in earnest the treasure chest of songs that have been everyone's property for a half score decades.

Music written by composers and which countless artists have gladly taken into their repertoire.  Which of the evening's songs Nat King Cole originally introduced may be discussed in the same way as a part of the actual information Natalie Cole provided on the occasion.  But it would be pure pedantry to go into that.
