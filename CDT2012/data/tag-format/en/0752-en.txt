"We sell the most when the men are along," confides the evening's presenter to me, while I eagerly consider whether I have enough money with me.  

Later, I am put discreetly in place, when she points out a star-grooved lid - white - and slightly patronisingly explains that "men often use the lid as a plate".  Model by model is shown from the laden shelf.

The whole time, the approximately 15 girls in attendance - and yours truly - are told that we can find it demonstrated in the illustration "on page ? in your catalogue".

The colour catalogue, which was distributed at the beginning of the session, is an important part of the kitchen culture.  In here, you can look everything up - if you are not already intimate with the page numbers as well as the production number, which many definitely seem to be.

In my quiet kitchen-uncultivated mind, it strikes me as strange that the breadbox set on page 9 is more expensive with the yellow lid than with the red.  The latter is for not immediately apparent reasons on sale.  But I don't make a face.  Betray nothing.
