The support for Gheorge Funar is surprising and evidence of the great tension that still exists between the country's large Hungarian minority and the rest of the population.  The 42-year old mayor of the provincial town of Cluj is one of the founders of the ultra-nationalist movement Vatra Romanesca.

He claims that the Hungarian government is undermining Romania in order to get Transylvania, which was formerly Hungarian, back."  If we don't step in, we will wind up in a Yugoslavian condition," says Funar.  Therefore, the Hungarians in Romania must be discriminated against, so that they do not attain the power that they have in mind, he believes.

Funar is rejected by most other political movements.  But in the second round of the presidential election, he will have an important role, because he will ask his voters to support Iliescu.

The Infas prognosis also shows that Iliescu's supporters in the DNSF group will be the largest group in Parliament.  DNSF can count on 27.5 percent of the votes.  Constantinescu's people, gathered into the Democratic Alliance, will receive only 23 percent; while the former minister president Petre Roman's social democratic NSF will be attributed eleven percent.
