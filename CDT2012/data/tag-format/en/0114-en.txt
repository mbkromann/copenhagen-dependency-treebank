"Since the Minister for Housing won't, then I will have to do it," says Kristen Jacobsen, referring to the fact that the Housing Minister Svend Erik Hovmand (V) has refused to do anything, before the attorney general's office has assessed the case.

Thus, she is literally taking Youth Housing's former chairman, Torben Lund at his word, since the vice chairman of the Social Democratic group said last night to TV 2 News that "it is up to a judge to decide whether illegalities have been committed in Youth Housing's administration."

In her report, Kirsten Jacobsen will ask the commissioner of police to investigate whether the National Association of Youth Housing has committed fraudulent abuse of authority, embezzlement and fraud in connection with the state's million-crown subsidy to Youth Housing's activities.

NEW REVELATIONS

Since Youth Housing went into bankruptcy three weeks ago with a deficit of DKK 44.1 million, hardly a day has passed without new incriminating revelations turning up about the way Youth Housing ran its non-profit leasehold business.  A large part of Youth Housing's 1,600 youth residences and 2,200 lodgings are threatened with a foreclosure sale.  150 employees at the main office risk a pink slip, and many renters, several municipalities, the trade union movement, a bank and the state all are owed money.
