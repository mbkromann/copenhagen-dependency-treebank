But it is not just owners of the tanning salons that fiddle with the solariums.

"We have often had to stress to the suppliers that, when we have approved an apparatus with a filter, the filter must remain in place.  It is all too often that we are out on such cases.

There are certain tanning salons we visit time and again, where the safety is not in order.  We have seen solariums, where there has been a risk of electric shock.  We have seen fire break out in the upper part of a solarium.  And then we have seen solariums, where the automation was not in order.  Where, for example, the upper part could not be pulled up," says Finn Rønlov Andersen.

Signe Sylvest, who herself owns Riviera Solcenter in Århus calls Denmark a banana republic, when it comes to the regulation and supervision of tanning salons.

"There should be some minimum requirements for the establishment of tanning salons along with subsequent regular supervision.  As it is today, anyone can slap together a salon.  I know examples of takeout grills and flower shops that have a couple of tanning booths in the back.
