Parents have name imposed on their child ÅRHUS: The parents of 11-month old Camilla, Finn Bech-Nielsen and Maja Illum, Ry ved Skanderborg, must live with the fact that their daughter has received a different last name from her four-year-old big sister.  This is because the Minister for Justice Hans Engell (Cons.) would not amend the two-year old regulation on user fees for changing birth certificates with retroactive force.  Therefore, the parents must pay DKK 3,000, if they want to give Camilla the desired surname - Bech-Illum - like her big sister Lærke.

Fanø enjoying the bounty of the sea ESBJERG: The sea takes and the sea gives.  The residents in Sønderho on Fanø can say something about the latter, writes JydskeVestkysten.  They have all become richer, thanks to the sea's "harvest" of a cargo of valuable mahogany and teak.  The largest wreck of recent times.  Even though a portion of the mahogany disappeared in the dead of night after the wreck last year, there is still quite a bit left, which was sold at auction.  It brought in a total of DKK 332,000.  A large part of the money will be sent to 179 households in Sønderho. (RB)
