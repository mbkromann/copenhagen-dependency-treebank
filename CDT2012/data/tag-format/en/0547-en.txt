Big "trailer rock" tours have become a concept within the music industry.  Up to a dozen large big rig caravans are criss-crossing Europe.  Building their own stages with light and sound equipment, employing up to 150 people twenty-four hours a day, while the tour lasts.

Nevertheless, this kind of tour can break even, if it is properly organized.

- I believe that, if the finances are handled reasonably, a world-class name can easily do a European tour and come home with DKK 20-30 million.  But the deficit could be just as big, relates Arne Wors√∏e.

There is a great secrecy around the finances of touring groups and even the concert organizer does not know what a group makes in profit, when the expenses have been deducted.

Normally, the artist's representatives and the concert organizer enter into a contract with a guarantee.

If, for example, a concert hall has a capacity of 5,000 seats, then the organizer must guarantee the artist a contract corresponding to, for example, a 70 percent occupancy.  If the concert is sold out, the organizer may get 20 percent of the revenue, the artist the rest.
