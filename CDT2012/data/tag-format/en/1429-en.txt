New at BTCC

Ford, Volkswagen and Renault are expected to get involved in British standard car racing in 1993.  BMW, Toyota, Vauxhall, Peugeot, Mazda and Nissan are already involved in the BTCC series, which Thorkild Thyrring has now put behind him after the mistake with the Andy Rouse team.  Audi, which recently withdrew from the German Group A series after controversies around a new crankshaft on the team's V8s, has informed its drivers - Stuck, Jelinski and Biela - that they are to "stroke the horse", and this is interpreted by observers as meaning that Audi will be back in 1993 and, therefore, has asked the drivers not to commit themselves elsewhere.

2,690 km per l.

A car built by French students could ruin gasoline companies, if it is put into mass production.  The car can drive just over 2,690 km on one litre of gasoline, which is a world record.  The unique car won in this special discipline in a competition with 73 other specially-built cars at the Silverstone track in Great Britain.  The earlier record was from 1988, when a Japanese built car drove 2,270 km on one litre.
