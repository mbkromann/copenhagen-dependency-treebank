Is Larsen tougher than you thought?

"The Jutlander is, as is well-known, strong and tough.  I think he brought to the business a much needed breath of fresh air, when he turned up.

He started out wanting to revolutionise quite a bit.  He didn't, but he created huge attention about getting out to travel.

He has helped give the business a lift

Larsen has stated that he does not consider the 70 million as a loss, but as the price of learning.  The question then is how much he will invest in a business that is in a period of a declining market.

Everybody still has the dream of getting away to experience something new and being together with foreign people, but many are waiting and seeing, because they feel the economic situation is uncertain.  That is something affecting the whole society."

Must you today, when you look into the rear-view mirror, acknowledge that the purchase of Tj√¶reborg was a mistake?
