The head of the Bosnian home guard, which consists primarily of Muslims, agreed with him.

"But we did not have precise information about the agreement that was entered into.  The people who carried out the ambush attack are, anyway, outside of our direct control," he said to the British TV station Sky.

Colm Doyle and UN representatives tried all of Monday to re-establish an agreement.  But the trust between the Muslims and the Serbs seems to have disappeared - if it was ever present.

The soldiers were handed over last night to the UN force in Yugoslavia.  At the same time, negotiations for another 84 soldiers who were taken prisoner in Bosnia continue, writes Reuter. 

The Muslims have also surrounded the Yugoslavian military hospital in Sarajevo, cut off water supply and prevented the delivery of food items.  

The Yugoslavian air force flew repeatedly over the capital city yesterday, presumably on reconnaissance for designating new bombing targets.  In Slavonski Brod, a Croatian city on the border of Bosnia, eight children and two women were killed, when a bomb from a Yugoslavian plane destroyed their air-raid shelter, say local defence authorities.
