The lead content in 98 octane leaded gasoline has up to this point in most companies - including Statoil - been 0.15 grams per liter.  That is a maximum limit established by the authorities.

"But with the current composition of the Danish fleet of cars, it would be no problem to lower the lead content by a quarter.  It can be done by blending 25 percent lead-free gasoline into the new quality," Statoil's PR head, Kai Nielsen, reports.

Texaco, which three weeks ago put a new gasoline product on the street with altered additives, also removed 25 percent of the leaded gasoline in 98 octane gas.

"But we decided to let the fall in price benefit our dealers," says deputy director Jan E. Nilsson to Ritzau.  He calculates the price difference at only three Ã¸re.

At Shell, they have no plans of replacing a portion of the leaded 98 octane with lead-free.  Shell hesitates "Not immediately.  We want to be completely sure that the car manufacturers guarantee that the cars can tolerate it," says PR head Margrethe Skov.  Some years ago, Shell had to pull a product off the market, because it damaged a number of car engines.
