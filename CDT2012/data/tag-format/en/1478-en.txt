Modestly and still not entirely unaffected by the shock, Jens Christian Poulsen, a 34-year old carpenter from Frederikshavn, tells how, in a furious race against time, he saved a 45-year man, employed by the Royal Danish Navy from drowning in the cold waves off Skagen.

As a crewman for the maritime home guard, Jens Christian Poulsen, nicknamed "Kesse," was aboard a home guard cutter, the HVM71 Scorpius, on manoeuvres at Herthas Flak a few nautical miles east of Skagen, when in the bridge of the cutter he suddenly heard "man overboard" being shouted.

"I went out to look and just at that moment saw the silhouette of a man in the water.  It was almost seven-thirty and it was already beginning to get dark.  I put on my Secumar vest at a furious pace, while skipper Tom Christiansen turned the ship.

I could see that the man overboard had been under water and was on his way up again.  I didn't hesitate for a second.  With a lifebuoy and a light buoy in my hand, I jumped into the water.  FACE UNDER WATER
