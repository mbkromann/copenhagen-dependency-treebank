Paul-Loup Sulitzer delivers the goods about once a year.  And the Per Kofod Publishing House has made itself the agent for the products on the domestic market, first with a serial on Helena Rubinstein, Hannah the first volume is called, and most recently with three volumes on Kate Killenger and Rourke, two success stories from the American magazine world.

The part about success is true enough.  But, of course, they must always go through so much that is dreadful - otherwise, there would be no excitement.  Readers of the first two volumes, Reporter and Kate, know the unshakeable star reporter Rourke, who wanders around the world almost wading in civil wars and other bloodshed, which he transforms into "good material", stories, which his agents sell to magazines the world over.  They also know Kate, the daughter of the magazine tycoon Killinger, who does what he can to crush his daughter's newly-launched daily.  Father and daughter have difficulties with each other - and in the third volume - The Road to Peking - the conflict is not successfully resolved, either.  Old Killinger dies, which simply makes Kate's problem with him even more insoluble.
