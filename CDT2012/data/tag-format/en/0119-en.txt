Yesterday, the two men charged claimed that the computer man only called to say that he was going to hit on some ladies.  That was what was meant by "customers".  At 5:05 p.m., the same day, he called again:

"I counted on you using a telephone booth.  This is a stupid telephone," said "the Mercedes man".

And after a quick call to his friend's hotel, they agreed that the 24-year old should find a telephone booth and call a half hour later.

"Did you have any suspicions that the telephone was tapped?" asked prosecutor Annette Vester.

The computer man: "Why should it be?  I just didn't want to talk to him if there were others nearby.  Then, my wife might get suspicious, and it is no concern of others, if I was at a brothel in Holland."

"The Mercedes man": "I was supposed to go to another telephone, because he was going to tell about his debaucheries in Holland." 

Before the computer man drove to Holland, the police also listened to a conversation between "the Mercedes man" and one of his friends.  He was supposed to come out to an address to get something, before it was dark.
