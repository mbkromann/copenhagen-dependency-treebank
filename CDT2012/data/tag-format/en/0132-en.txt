SOMETHING UP THE SLEEVE

"I am not going to forget that ball very soon," maintained Hauth after the meet, "but otherwise I am quite satisfied that I was so close against Grubba and afterwards also took a set from Appelgren and showed something of the best I can do."

"They have something up their sleeves and more power reserves that we have, but I am happy that I could take a set from the world's no. 1," added Allan Bentsen to the conversation.

The Swedes had counted on getting a finale sweep, but the Pondus winner for the last two years Jean-Michel Saive put a stopper to that, when in the semi-finals he continued his magnificent play from the introductory rounds and won over Appelgren with 21-15, 21-10.
