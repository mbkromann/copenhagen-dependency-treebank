KOLDING: So the car salesman from Kolding, Christian Christensen, is once again ready to take up the struggle with the partisans in the jungles of Guatemala.  This time in the companionship of JÃ¸rn Middelhede, also from Kolding.

"Our target is a particular cave in which the Mayan Indians have painted inscriptions on the wall," says Christian Christensen, who is traveling from Billund to Guatemala on Tuesday.

He had the same target two years ago, along with traveling companion Jan Harp Nielsen, but their ambitions had to be abandoned.

"Out of concern for our own safety.  It was death squads who had the real power in the area," says Christian Christensen.

He got the proof himself, when he arrived in Guatemala.  A couple of weeks before, his very good friend, American archaeologist Mike de Vine, had been found killed.  One day he was kidnapped and the next day he was found with his neck half severed.

"Neither the military nor the police did anything.  At that time, you could hire a paid assassin for DKK 75," says the car salesman.
