-  It's the elf, said Anni.

The doorbell rang, and it was the children's mother who opened the door to the snow-covered yard and the snow-powdered trees in front of the house.  She was speechless.  Out in the yard, by the steps, stood a tall man in an elf outfit, smiling with a red mouth deep inside the white cotton beard.

-  Good evening, he said with a dry, creaky voice.  -  Do two children live here in this house?  A boy called Orla ? and a little girl called Anni?

Orla and Anni, who had followed their mother out to the front door, stood in the open door and stared up at the tall man with happy eyes.

-  My name is Orla, Orla hurried to say.

-  And my name is Anni, said Anni, jumping and dancing on her feet.

-  Then, here you go, said the man in the elf outfit, setting the light brown sack of presents on the landing in front of the front door.  -  And a Merry Christmas to you all.
