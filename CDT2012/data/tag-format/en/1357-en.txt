It is a long way from the dusty Kabul suburb of Karte Seh with squat clay houses and tall mountains back home to Holb√¶k, where her boyfriend Holger is waiting.

"Jeez, how I miss him."

A couple of hours later, shortly before six o'clock in the morning, her Danish colleague Anne-Mette Larsen gets up.  Looks out the window towards the snow-covered Hindu Kush mountains.

"Er.  The sun is shining."

And when the sun is shining, the children play in the fields and by the side of the road.  Crawl around on the mountainsides.  When spring breaks forth, the women walk in the fields.

Everywhere else on the globe, a beautiful day.

In Afghanistan, a day in which women and children walk the gauntlet between the at least 20 million landmines, scattered across the entire country.
