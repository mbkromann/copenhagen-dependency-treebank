With that, the German finance minister declared that the Government in Bonn would work to make sure that the financial stability of the D-mark in Germany also continues after the economic and monetary union has commenced in the entire EC.  For domestic political reasons, Waigel has several times stressed that Germans do not need to have any fear of what will happen, when the EC introduces the ECU as a common monetary standard for the whole EC.

"It is not the intent for the D-mark to be taken over by an ECU.  To the contrary, it is the stability and money policy of Germany that is to be taken over by the rest of the EC," said Waigel recently during a discussion on the future economic union in the EC.

Also, the chairman of the liberal FDP Party, Otto Graf Lambsdorff, said on Sunday that there are still a number of open questions in connection with the ECU.  "It is still very unclear what will happen if a member country breaks with the financial discipline.  No one knows what sanctions will be imposed upon the relevant country.  Therefore, it is very uncertain how the ECU will actually come to look," said Lambsdorff.
