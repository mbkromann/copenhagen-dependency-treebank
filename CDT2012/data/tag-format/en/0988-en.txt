This means that, without further ado, the refugees are going to be put onto the street.  The refugees at the Holiday Inn, for example, have received that message.

"It is in a situation like this one that terrorism arises.  We are about to become a people without opportunities or prospects.  I am beginning to understand the views of the Palestinians," says Darko Richter, who is a pediatrician in Zagreb.

After a year of war, he says straight out that his views have radicalized materially, since Croatia declared itself independent last year:

"We can no longer live on airlifts and emergency aid convoys.  Give us weapons!" says Dr Richter.
