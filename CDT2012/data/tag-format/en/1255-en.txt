My job was clear: pressure was to be put on Danida and thereby the government of Bhutan to get the persecution stopped and thereby the stream of refugees.

Therefore, I composed an article that, first and foremost, criticised Danida's continued engagement in a country that systematically persecuted half of the population.  The article was published at the end of May in Jyllands-Posten, Berlingske Tidende and the Århus Stiftstidende.  In addition, I wrote to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in a modest hope that they were interested in an eyewitness account.

A week later, I received a standard rejection from Jyllands-Posten.  The Århus Stiftstidende replied that they were not interested, since a staff member was soon to go to the area.  Berlingske Tidende's rejection did not come until six weeks later and looked to a T like the rejection from Jyllands-Posten.

The Minister for Foreign Affairs replied a couple of weeks later.  He believed the situation was improving and that the stream of refugees was diminishing.  At somewhat the same time, I received reports from the refuge camps that the numbers in the camps now had risen to over 40,000 and that the assaults inside Bhutan had intensified.
