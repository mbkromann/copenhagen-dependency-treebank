Tonight, Silkeborg Hall will resound with the call of Moscow Calling!, but this is not to be mixed up with a cry for help from the large crisis-ridden country to the east.

To the contrary, it is one of Russia's few success stories that will be appearing, when the rock group Gorky Park commences their Denmark tour in the city of the beautiful lakes.

Tomorrow, Gorky Park is playing at Ringsted and cementing thereby the great popularity the band achieved with explosive speed, when they hit the charts in Denmark with "Bang Bang" just under three years ago.  In the summer of 1990, Gorky Park played at the Roskilde Festival and that same year moved their base from Moscow to Dallas, Texas, where they are trying to follow up the success from their debut.

Whether this will succeed is difficult to say, because Gorky Park finds itself stylistically in a slightly overrun area, where groups such as Def Leppard, Scorpions and MÃ¶tley Crue are the top dogs.

But, at least, Gorky Park's latest recording "Moscow Calling" has proved a hit here at home with its refrain-sure melodiousness and hard-pumped guitars of the highly polished sort.
