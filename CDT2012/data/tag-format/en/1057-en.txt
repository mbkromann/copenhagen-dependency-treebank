It is easy to mobilise "righteous indignation" over what one considers "outrageous ignorance", (as Beinov, for example, does), but the question in the end is whether there is a concept of general education that a greater number of Danes can even be somewhat in agreement about?  People's children are quite different, and the need for books (by which Beinov is obsessed), is not as ordinary today as, for example, 20 years ago.  Danes are, like other peoples, a product of the education they have received - apart from the trendy currents of the time.

Television culture certainly has part of the blame for the predominant antipathy for reading novels among not only young people but also the tall and burly.  You cannot ordinarily "beat off" the TV media's ephemeral stream of information, just as entertainment, whether through television or in some other way, blocks out more time than a couple of decades back.  Attitudes towards the acquisition of knowledge have shifted, some will even acknowledge that it has become much more relaxed than before.
