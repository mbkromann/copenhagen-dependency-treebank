The Knudsen family in the village of Akkerup near Assens were terror-stricken eyewitnesses to a tragic airplane accident at noon on Sunday, in which three people died.

The dead are 42-year old Palle Kreiberg-Nielsen, Tommerup, and Kim Scavenius Johnsen, 32, Tommerup, as well as Palle Kreiberg-Nielsen's friend, Inger Agnes Mandrup Flindtgaard, 54, Slangerup.

Palle Kreiberg was a teacher but, in his free time, he worked as an aerial photographer with a firm by the name of Gy-Kort.  On Saturday, he called Birthe Knudsen, 40, who knew Palle Kreiberg a bit through her work as an artist.

Palle Kreiberg asked whether she was interested in a picture of her childhood home and, when she answered in the affirmative, they agreed that the plane should come by on Sunday around lunchtime.

"I was standing in a brook, washing my boots after some garden work, when I saw the plane approach.  It is incredible that they can fly so low and so slow, I thought," says Christian Knudsen, 71, retired engineer.

COURSE TOWARD BUSHES

The single-engine Cessna 172 plane with room for four people flew in a direction towards a row of four-meter high bushes.
