A couple of pieces of good advice.

The Egyptian Sinuhe, the lonely doctor, said that, once you have drunk from the waters of the Nile, you will long to go back.  Today, he would have been dead many times over, because the Nile is so polluted that, if you were merely to stick a finger into the river, you would risk absorbing a parasite into your system.

Therefore, never eat vegetables or drink water from the faucet.  You should rather have plastic liter bottles.  If you do not watch out, then you will, guaranteed, get what is called the Cairo step.  A good piece of advice on which I survived is two pills of Paragurth plus a large gulp of Fernet Branca three times a day.

Another good piece of advice is to make your next trip to Egypt.  It is an experience of a lifetime.

Pharaohs' tutelary god Honus - king of the world - is often represented with the head of a falcon and a double crown.
