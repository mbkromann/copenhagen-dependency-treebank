Michael Christiansen also expressed amazement to the Court of Inquiry on Wednesday at Erik Ninn-Hansen's explanation that, in December 1987 on the basis of the December 2 memo, he was supposed to have given what he himself calls a "directive" that family reunifications were to be given lower priority and that this should particularly affect Tamil refugees. 

But it was not only Ninn-Hansen's explanation to the court that had surprised the permanent secretary.  The explanations of former colleagues in the Ministry of Justice have also amazed him, it emerged from the hearing on Wednesday.

In court, a number of prominent officials have explained in great detail how disquieted they were over the Tamil halt.  But even though Michael Christiansen later spoke on several occasions with his former colleagues, among them, the director for the Directorate of Immigration, Frederik Schydt, on the Tamil case, they never provided such a detailed expression of their concerns, explained the permanent secretary.

Nor had Michael Christiansen ever heard anything about giving a lower priority to the Tamil cases, while he himself was in the Ministry of Justice, even though Frederik Schydt on several occasions complained about a lack of resources.  The official explanation for giving lower priority to the Tamil family reunification cases - the so-called false melody - was precisely a lack of resources in the Ministry.
