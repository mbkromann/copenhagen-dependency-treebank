On a trip to East and Central Europe, you meet many peoples - and, particularly, the gypsies, who are a nomadic people.  Here is the account of an encounter with gypsies in a train between Budapest and Prague.

Summer in the new Europe.  Out sightseeing with DSB - out airing your inner gypsy on a free-ranging trip through several countries.

With beautiful Hungary as good as experienced out, and Prague as the next stop, you can be entirely certain of meeting some real gypsies.

Of course, also on the night train from Budapest to Prague, where you save an "expensive" hotel stay, because you're travelling at night.

The main train station in Budapest is buzzing with activity.  It is obvious, which line we have to get into - and yet the signs sow confusion, so we each decide to get into our own line.

Two sleeping berths are what we want, and as travellers through East and Central Europe, we know you can't always set your mind on luxury.
