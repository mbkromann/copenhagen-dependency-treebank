The only one of the otherwise ready-for-the-scrap-heap vessels, which absolutely must not sail any longer, is the submarine Killer Whale, S327, which since 1957 has kept watch on the Baltic Sea and, every so often, also out on the Atlantic as a unit of STAVLANDNORTH, NATO's standing Atlantic fleet.

"The terms of the auction simply say that the Killer Whale is to be scrapped and certain parts are then to be delivered to the Navy," reports senior grade commander Per Mikkelsen at Holmen in Copenhagen.

Actually, Holmen will also soon be for sale.

QUICK AND EXPENSIVE

The Navy's auction includes four patrol boats of the Daphne class, built at the beginning of the Sixties at the Naval Dockyard, five gas turbine torpedo ships of 

the Sea Lion class, all delivered from the navy dockyard in 1965-67.  They are awfully fast: they can run up to 54 knots, because they are equipped with a total of 12,750 HP on the three gas turbine engines.  But it is expensive to keep them running.

Finally, the patrol vessel, Fylla, is also for sale.  It, too, was built at the beginning of the Sixties at the Aalborg Dockyard and has since sailed faithfully to the Faeroe Islands and Greenland.
