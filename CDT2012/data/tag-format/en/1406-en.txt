"We put a German in, we take a German out.  We put a German in, oooohhh, then, we shake him all about!"

And shaken the Germans were.  And it was not just those on the field:

"I have never seen Hamburg so empty, there was no one on the streets here after the match.  But we have to congratulate you on a fantastic victory," it was said dejectedly yesterday evening by Harold Richard, a sports reporter for Germany's largest paper, Bild, before it was his heavy duty to fill his paper with the greatest German defeat in the memory of sportsmen.

It was even Bild that, the day before the EC final match, wrote across its entire front page: "Sorry, Danes, but today the victory is ours":

"Yes, we wrote that ? but now we have to write congratulations.  For once, our luck ran out, and we bow to your quality play.

It was the sport that won last night.

The German national team lacked quality play in every match except the match against Sweden.
