The US sees it as in its clear interest that Europe become a strong political and economic factor in the new world order.  It will ease the US's own global tasks and, at the same time, open a rich market for American exports.  But the prospect of a new, unified Europe with the EC as the political and economic dynamo and Germany as the new leading major power nevertheless makes some Americans uncomfortable.  They feel displaced and see that they are about to lose influence in Europe, where they have played so dominant a role for almost half a century.  In the slightly longer view, they see Europe rising up as a political rival and economic competitor, and this does not go down well with everyone.

Europe will face colossal challenges in the coming years and must find new paths and roles both for itself and for its relationship to the two old superpowers.  From each its own corner of the world, Moscow and Washington will follow Europe's new course with a mix of benevolent interest, curiosity and watchfulness, while a new global field of tension is about to take shape.
