"It's fun, when I'm standing here.  I can see people outside react.  "God, they're really ugly" is what you hear most.

But there are also some who buy.  People like them, even though they're ugly," says Peter Elmegaard, looking out on Kronprinsensgade.  Peter Elmegaard is in charge of ordering the shoes and runs the shop on a daily basis.

The shop has only been there for a few months, but the snub-nosed shoes are already walking around in Copenhagen in many exemplars.  On average, 10 pairs of shoes cross the counter a day.

Most of the ghastly shoes are sold to very young girls.  The rest go to people who like to be different.

And you have to be to wear a pair of post-box-red shoes with five-centimetre raw rubber platform soles and a red rolled-up tongue at the instep ?
