We pick them gently, brush the topsoil from their hats and set our teeth into the raw flesh of the mushroom.  It is crisp and delicious, and the taste is gentle, nutty and fresh.

-  The ink cap is the species designation from Henning Knudsen, associate professor at the Botanical Museum in Copenhagen and author of Politiken's Mushroom Book, which has been printed in four editions and 26,000 copies in all.

Henning Knudsen is one of Denmark's leading mushroom experts, and we have invited him to go along on a mushroom hunt in Hare Forest north of Copenhagen, equipped with a wicker basket and a knife.

It is the high season for mushrooms at the end of September and in October and, during our walk in the woods, we meet many others, who with their gaze fastened on the aromatic forest floor are looking for some of the attractive Danish edible mushrooms.

The mushrooms are found in every Danish wood, but naturally some places are better than others.


BEST MUSHROOM YEAR

-  And this year is the best mushroom year in a long time.  It is due to a special combination of weather conditions, where the summer was dry and warm, followed by a wet period, which has suited the mushrooms fine, says Henning Knudsen.
