But as time goes by, the infatuation disappears, and the everyday brings greater or fewer surprises.  Some people you can learn to live with, others not.  That is the way it is with Parken, too.

Parken has flaws and defects that the football audience neither can nor will live with.

It may be there are not 101 flaws, but there are at least these:

1. The building owner Baltica Finans and architect Gert Andersson have forgotten the detail of building ticket offices.  For national games, spectators have usually ordered and purchased tickets far in advance.  But for FC KÃ¸benhavn's games, the ticket sales are a catastrophe.  The lines are so long that many have just left again.  Others have arrived so late in Parken that they have missed quite a lot of goals.

2. The security fence around the field is constructed so poorly that several hundred people cannot see because of the large steel construction sitting right at eye-level.

3. The same holds true for various places in the C stands, opposite the main stands, where several rows cannot see properly because of standing rails and poles at the stairways.
