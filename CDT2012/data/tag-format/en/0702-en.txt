I have seen her mentioned as oil wealthy Lynn Wyatt, as Texas society princess Lynn Wyatt.  And now when her son has come into the public limelight, I have finally obtained information about her that makes the pieces of her biographical mosaic fall into place.

A not inessential detail in this biography, however, has shocked me.  A detail that gave my aha, my oho, my well well, my see see, my hmhm a little tone of disappointment.  It appears that the lady is 62.  If one is to believe the papers, she looks, of course, 20 years younger.  And in the circles in which Lynn Wyatt moves, it is a matter, first and foremost, of appearance.

But as mentioned: her circle is not my circle.  And I must admit: this was the shock for which I was not prepared.  So, now I'm sitting there, feeling cheated.  Think that I should end as the man who knew too much!
