Against impotence

The two recipients, however, have each worked with their own material.  Jan Fahrenkrug has studied the so-called VIP, which among other things is capable of increasing the blood circulation in various places in the body.  He has discovered that it is not a hormone at all, but one of the nerve system's many signal substances that can increase blood circulation to the corpus cavernosum of a penis.  This can produce an erection.

Jan Fahrenkrug has, among other things, worked together with a professor of gynaecology at Hvidovre Hospital, Dr. Bent Ottesen and, together with doctors at Herlev Hospital, he has tried to use VIP on around fifty men with erectile dysfunction as a result of a defect in nerve function.  One injects VIP into a penis shortly before intercourse and then an erection occurs with a duration that depends on the amount of VIP injected.  Even the injection, the patients undertake themselves.

Larger studies with the drug are planned, and people are also looking at its possibilities for revealing certain rare types of tumours.
