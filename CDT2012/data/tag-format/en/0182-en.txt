On November 12, Roskilde Cathedral will be the setting for the first of a series of concerts the Norwegian singer Sissel Kyrkjebø will give in Denmark.

Sissel Kyrkjebø, who two years ago drew over 20,000 listeners to sold-out concerts in large halls, has this time chosen to appear exclusively in churches.  This means that far fewer will have the opportunity to be present at her concerts.  But according to Jens Hofman of her Danish promoter, the record company Medley, it is the desire to sing in a church space more than business that has been decisive for Sissel Kyrkjebø.

In addition to Roskilde, the singer with a voice as clear as Norwegian mountain air will also sing in Copenhagen, Odense, Århus, Randers and Holstebro.  Under the heading Coastland, she offers a mixture of hymns, psalms and newer songs accompanied by a quartet of flute, contrabass, cello and synthesizer.

The concert in Roskilde will be distinguished from the five others by having the profit from the event go to an AIDS project in Tanzania.  Behind the initiative is the Roskilde Cathedral parish church council and several private sponsors.
