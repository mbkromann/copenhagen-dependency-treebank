Simon Wiesenthal is 83 and, even at his high age, is still active in his hunt for former Nazis who are hiding all over the world.

He is also still active as an author: Munksgaard publishers has just published a second edition of the book "Justice - Not Vengeance", which is reckoned by the author to be his last book.

Here, he describes his work up until 1989.  And the book is not, as one might believe, negative and hateful.  As the author, among other things, writes in his foreword: 

"I'm still an optimist, and I believe that intolerance is capable of dominating our lives only for limited periods - ultimately tolerance will prevail."

That Wiesenthal survived the war is a miracle.  He was placed in 12 different concentration camps in all, among them Lvov, where only 34 of 149,000 Jews remained alive after the war.

And that they were is quite simply due to the fact that the prison guards used them as an excuse not to be sent to the front.
