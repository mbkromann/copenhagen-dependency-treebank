She has, among other things, received tens of thousands in audience and has over 20 years shaken up towards 100,000 hands, has traveled around the world countless times on visits to every part of the world.  India is one of the few, major countries she has left to visit.

In the 20-year period in which Margrethe and Henrik have been a royal couple, they have been on 27 state visits, plus a long series of various more or less official trips.
