The year after, I became a football apprentice at Arsenal, and then I had discovered my true calling."

He made his debut against Iceland in May 1986.  In the summer of 1990, he switched from Arsenal to Manchester City.

"I'm very happy to be with City and have extended my contract to the summer of 1997."

The partnership with trim veteran, 34-year old John Aldridge from Tranmere, has led to several important Irish goals.

KNOWS HIS JOB

"I know my job together with John.  We understand each other well, and I enjoy heading him free for scoring.

Against Denmark, it will presumably be Torben Piechnik from Liverpool and me who will go head to head.  I have never met him before, only seen him play in TV matches.

He had an unfortunate debut match, 2-4 against Aston Villa, but later he has distinguished himself with solid play.

It is worth remarking that Liverpool's defence has become more stable after Piechnik's entry".

All of Ireland hopes that Quinn's dried-up stream of goals begins to flow again tonight.
