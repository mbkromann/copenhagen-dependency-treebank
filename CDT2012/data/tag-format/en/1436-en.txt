The surviving Polish seaman, Krzysztof Samsel, 30, who was flown by helicopter to the Norwegian town of Farsund, stated in a captain's protest yesterday that he had only saved his life because of an air bubble that had pushed him away from the sinking ship.

"Otherwise, I would have been sucked down with it," explained Samsel. 

SIX ARE GONE

It is thought that six other crew members on the Kamilla, who were on their way from Rekefjord, Norway, to Rendsburg, Germany, with its cargo of stone have gone down with the ship.

After the collision, the Isafold immediately put a rubber boat with an outboard motor into the water.  But the crew saw only the solitary Pole.

The coastguard ship Lafjord has salvaged wreckage from the sunken ship, among other things, two empty life rafts and a lifeboat.  But there is still no trace of the six crew members, all men between the ages of 30-50.

Skipper and mates on the Isafold met at Hirtshals yesterday with the shipping company's attorney and insurance representatives.
