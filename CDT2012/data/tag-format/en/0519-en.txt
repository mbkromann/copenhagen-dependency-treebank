"No, not like that!  But you can call it that, if you want!"

Over the last five - six years, have your paintings gotten a far more intense, almost erotic expression, you have dared "to fight back tooth and nail" and set free liberating forces?

"Yes, you dare a bit more and that is why I won't agree with your term "rebellious", it has more to do with venturing, daring "to dare"."

Do you venture more, when you get older?

"Apparently!  Some venture most, when they are young.  For others, it takes a little more time to reach that form of youth, where you are able to venture.  For me, art has something to do with venturing."

How do you view the  reaction of others to your art?

"I think it has been positive beyond all bounds: One of the reasons for my reticence has been: "Can you take it, if people criticise you too much?"  But I have had a reception that has been incredibly inspiring in itself.  I think I have been greeted with more of a curious benevolence."
