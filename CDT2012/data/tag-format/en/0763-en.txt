The butcher received unexpected guests on Saturday and resolutely browned a pork shoulder fillet at DKK 68 per kg in a frying pan, letting it simmer with herbs.  After half an hour, he poured sliced potatoes into the mixture and continued to let the dish simmer, until the potatoes were tender.  After spicing it properly, he was very proud of the easy meal for his guests.  

The ground meat for Thursday's lamb pat√© costs DKK 90 per kg, but then it is also trimmed.  Danish chops are sold for DKK 150 per kg, calves' liver for DKK 60 per kg.

The week's cheapest dinner is the flounder - DKK 25 for five small flounders without roe, and a quantity discount increases, if you buy for the freezer.  Cheap, too, are the two large plaice at DKK 35, two smoked lumpsuckers for a fiver less. Or try a swordfish steak at DKK 20 per piece, or red sea trout at DKK 59 per kg for a whole, 20 crowns more for a filet.  The lumpfish caviar has fallen a bit to DKK 75-80 per kg unrinsed.
