"I like you.  I also think you're sweet.  But it is in more like a friendly way.  The way I like Karin.  I think you understand what I mean, don't you?"

Maja forces herself to nod.

"I thought so.  I'm also just saying it to make sure.  There are some girls who jump to a lot of conclusions."

He seems relieved.  Maja does not dare look at him.  Then, he would be able to see that she has tears in her eyes.

"You mustn't cry!  You musn't cry!  You mustn't cry!" it resounds within her the whole time.

She wishes he would go now.  She cannot take it very much longer.  

"Are you mad?" he asks suddenly.

Maja shakes her head.  No, she is not mad.  She is utterly miserable.  But he cannot know that.  Nor will he!
