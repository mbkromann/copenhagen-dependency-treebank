The chairman of the  Financial Services Union, Søren Dalmark, was also in agreement that a strategy must be laid out against future mass firings.  In his report, he said that the Financial Services Union will propose "contacts and discussions" both locally and between the union and the Finance Sector's Employers Confederation.

"The purpose is, of course, to find out: What is the right level for the number of employees?  What is the right level for how we should serve our customers?  What is the right level for how much money we are to earn?" asked Dalmark.

Here, he also wanted to involve the customers.  Søren Dalmark suggested that employees "profile themselves as the customers' friend".

"We have up until now stood shoulder to shoulder with our management and defended their plans.  But now we should instead ally ourselves with the customers.  We must ask them what they want and what they want to pay for", he opined.

Such an alliance can also be used in collective bargaining in 1993, when the new job security agreements are expected to be one of the primary topics, Dalmark believes.
