"On the basis of the girl's extended residence in the home, the administration does not find that anything more should be done in this case, and the administration does not find that there is a basis for dissolution of the foster care relationship now."

The Municipality of Herning's social affairs committee accepts the recommendation reported to Mona Lisa in a letter.

The family will be allowed to live in peace, but the authorities would like to cover up the case.  For several months, they refuse to give the family access to documents in the case.

After a legal tug of war, the papers are handed over, and the Municipality of Herning pays the family's legal fees, when Merete Haugaard threatens to go to the press.

On May 9, 1990 the Municipality of Herning records in Mona Lisa's case file that the municipality has paid DKK 10,000 for Mona Lisa's sessions with a psychologist.  The kidnapping-like action is paid.

B.T. has asked psychologist Sine Diemar for more detailed comments, but she wishes neither to hear the article nor make any comments.

B.T. has provided the article to attorney J. Quade Andersen, Herning, who by his intervention prevented Mona Lisa from being removed from her father and mother.
