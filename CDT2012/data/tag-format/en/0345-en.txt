She turns around to him and says, amazed: "Didn't you know that?  There is a wonderful little estate over on the east side of the island."


He nods.  "What time shall I expect you?" he asks a little uncertainly.


She walks past him and opens the door to the living room.


"We can meet out there at seven o'clock.  Maybe, you will get an invitation.  I will tell George that you are coming."


He follows her into the living room.


"So it's a date.  You have to go now."


Her voice brooked no opposition.  He wanted to have stayed in bed with her a bit longer.  Maybe, stayed here overnight.  Then, he wouldn't have needed to go home to that terrible house on the hill.


He looks around at her cosy living room and then walks towards the exit door.  He turns around and tries to give his voice a cheery tone, when he says: "Well, goodbye then.  I'll see you on Friday."
