"Everything went well.  Whether it was my best fight ever, I'll have to analyse more closely.  But it was at any rate one of the better ones, particularly when you think that I was in a fight that could be considered my biggest chance ever to go to the Olympic Games," said Jesper D. Jensen.

Even though the goal of the Olympic Games was reached, there was no time for great festivities, although Jesper D. Jensen believed that he might just permit himself a single sausage.  "I will have to retain my weight for the fight tomorrow (today, ed.)".

Here, in the semi-finals, he meets the Pole Leszek Olszewski, who is a national champion and has won 123 of 136 fights.

"I might well be afraid that there would come a reaction, now that my ticket to the Olympic Games is assured.  But I box to win gold, and it is also a question of honour," said Jesper D. Jensen.

With a victory, super-heavyweight Brian Nielsen could likewise pave his way to Barcelona, but his quarter-final match against the Swede Peter Jaako was fought after going to press.
