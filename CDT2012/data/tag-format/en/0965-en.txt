Those in charge have not made themselves available for comment.  These busy men have in effect dismissed the problem by abbreviating it to a couple of ideas, problematic in themselves, on more referenda and a higher cut-off limit for election to Parliament.

If the depth and seriousness of the problem is not accepted, it may be because the crisis of the parties is not at the moment a crisis for democracy - which Danes, to the contrary, praise even more uniformly than ever before and more than almost all other countries.  It is the line from voters to those in government that has worn so thin that most themselves now have to get their knowledge from the media and the environment instead of following politicians - even in very difficult cases.  Instead of the usual "organised democracy", we have gotten a "market democracy", where parties, organisations and politicians no longer act as permanent representatives for particular groups but offer their policies to the public at large, which soon assesses them with scepticism and a watchful eye on other offers.
