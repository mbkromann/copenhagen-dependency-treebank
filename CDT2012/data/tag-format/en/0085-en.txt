Several times, Brian Sand has been accompanied by his dog on skiing trips to Poland.  And there the dog aroused attention, among other things, because Brian dressed it in a scarf and an old wind jacket with rolled up sleeves.  In part so, it wouldn't be cold, in part, to tone down its somewhat fierce appearance.  And the dog loved to rush after the family on skis down the hills.

LOOKS LIKE A PIG	

"There are often people who say that the dog looks like a pig, a tapir or has a mouth like a shark.  So in order to tone down its massive appearance and take the wind out of any aggression, I always call the dog at hand Hot Dog, when we meet a stranger.  This evokes smile.

But they are beautiful - not ugly."

Brian Sand was reminded of another strange episode regarding the bull terrier's appearance:

"In a local shop, I met a little boy who was hardly taller than the dog. "Look, mother, isn't it cute," he lisps.  The mother didn't think so, she looked the other way, but he pulled on her jacket and continued: "Look, mommy, it looks like a dog.""
