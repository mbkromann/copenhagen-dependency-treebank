The collar is tight around Peter's neck.  He dares not move his head for fear that it will come undone.  -  Berlin, sir he, but - my goodness - I didn't think that - 


-  Yes, Berlin, sir, the chief editor, you have already written superb articles on developments in the German republic.  Now you're going down to the scene of the crime itself.  You've visited down there, so far as I know.  Right?


Peter forgets the collar and nods eagerly.  Yes, he had been on vacation in Berlin with his father even in November 1918, when no outsider would dare travel into that chaos.  His father had heard the Social Democrat Scheidemann proclaim the democratic republic from the balcony in the Reichstag building.  He had himself sneaked down into the crowd in front of the former imperial palace and heard Karl Liebknecht proclaim the socialist republic based on workers' and soldiers' councils.


-  Good lord, Lange, quite a lot happened at that time.  Well - here come our tartelettes.
