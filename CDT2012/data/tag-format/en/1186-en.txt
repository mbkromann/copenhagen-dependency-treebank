Not even a military victory over Iraq has been able to preserve the president's popularity from the previous election in 1988, even though the nearby garrison town of Lawton sent 16,000 men to Saudi Arabia, and that entire region of Texas is still very proud of their efforts.

The war's local effect proved to be brief.  As a consequence of the end of the Cold War and the homecoming of many soldiers from Europe, there is a drastic reduction in military ranks, and the garrison town's significance as the primary engine for the area's economy will decrease drastically.  Victory in Texas decisive.

For Texas as a whole, it is the case that the state was in the process of reviving economically after the dip in oil prices at the beginning of the '80s, when the USA's economy in 1990 went into reverse with business closings and a rising number of the unemployed.

Since the Second World War, all the winners of American presidential elections have won their home states, and the same is true of all the losers except for Adlai Stevenson and George McGovern.  To win in Texas is simply a necessity for George Bush.
