ODENSE: Things went completely amok for OB in the local Funen rebellion.

National team player Lars Elstrup and Jens Madsen were suspended.   Nor could the most rabid fans control themselves.

Referee Villy Nielsen had to have the protection of the attendants to get free of the threatening OB fans at half-time and after the match.

"Dirty pig, dirty pig," around 30 fanatics screamed, while the attendants formed a chain so that none could get through.

OB had won, lock, stock and barrel, seven victories in a row, but yesterday it all collapsed.

"The stripes" - they got red thumps and red cards.

A terrible evening for OB.

Jens Madsen's expulsion in the 43rd minute was debatable.  It looked more like an accidental collision than a conscious act, the so-called emergency brake, when the OB'er stopped Lars Larsen just outside of the field.

"Lars edged in in front of me.  I couldn't avoid hitting him.  Neither of us even touched the ball," explained Jens Madsen.

On the other hand, there was no doubt that Lars Elstrup got carried away.  He kicked B1909's Ole Juel down as an act of revenge 20 minutes before time.
