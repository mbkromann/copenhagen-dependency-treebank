As a leader, Poul Harremoës is able to fill his employees with enthusiasm.  He is said to have an overwhelming "drive" and a commitment that infects everyone around him.

He is called "extremely professional" and "professionally honest".  The politicians experienced the latter, when at one point they introduced the first bill for the billion-crown aquatic environment action plan.  Harremoës criticised the bill for being superficial and unrealistic.  And it was revised.

Besides his professor job, Poul Harremoës, who is also a Knight of the Dannebrog, has had a number of international posts in recent years.  Among them, president for an international water pollution organisation and the driving force behind WHO's continuing education in the environmental area.

In his free time, groundwater is replaced by salt water beneath the keel.  Harremoës is the yachtsman incarnate, sailing each year in the Zealand Round with his son.  His wife Hanne does not like to sail and, therefore, twenty years ago as a mutual passion, the couple bought an old half-timbered house as a summer address at Møn.
