So never mind that old Plato passed on the story of Atlantis as a lesson on the misfortunes that will occur when a people become too cocky.

In the two-striped and well-cut book on werewolves, the author Nicolas Barbano provides reasonable explanations of how the myth could arise.  First of all: Mental illness can make the patient believe that he becomes a monster in the light of the full moon.  Second: People experience the world differently.  Young actors can easily create the illusion of being old men, so we almost believe in the transformation.  The necromancer can get his tribal kinsmen to see him in a wolf skin, but we do not buy the illusion here in this country, because we do not believe in magic, right?

In 1983, a man wanted to change his name to Werwolf, but he was not allowed to, because it was considered inappropriate and offensive.
