You loosen the soil with the cultivator, which is only for use in the vegetable garden in the spring, and it also pulls up weeds by the roots.  Soil preparation with the cultivator in the perennial beds destroys the plants' roots.  There are tools with three or four claws.  Depending on your energy, you can choose either a cultivator with five claws or three.  The easiest to penetrate the earth is the cultivator with three claws, but the one with five claws does the work better.  There is also cultivator with a soldered hoe for obstinate weeds.

Must cut sharply

Tools for cutting are a whole different matter.  Unfortunately, there are things on the market that are not good for anything.  You must not let yourself be tempted by a pair of pruning shears for DKK 25.  As a test purchase, the undersigned has two pruning shears from two low-price department stores.  One broke and the other is off-kilter.  Pruning shears cost between DKK 100 and 200, if they are to be able to make a clean cut.
