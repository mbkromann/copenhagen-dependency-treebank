A delivery van does not have a trunk

The luggage space in a delivery van is not a trunk like the lockable trunk in an ordinary passenger car in which you cannot see the luggage from the outside.  Not even if the windows in a delivery van are tinted and the luggage space is separate from the cabin.

Therefore, ordinary homeowners' insurance does not cover "special household effects" that are stolen from a delivery van, maintains a majority of the Insurance Appeals Board in a second ruling.

"Special household effects" means, among other things, cameras, TV and radio equipment, computer equipment and furs.

The owner of a video recorder had it stolen, while it was in a locked delivery van belonging to a firm that had the video recorder for repair.

The owner tried to have the loss compensated through his own homeowners' insurance, but the company refused, referring to the fact that the theft had occurred from a delivery van.  And the appeals board has upheld the company.

On the other hand, it is possible that the firm that had the video machine in its possession must replace it.
