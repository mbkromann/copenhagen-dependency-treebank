A bad root does not give good apples.

Rome was not built in a day.

All roads lead to Rome.

He who praises himself praises no one else.

No roses without thorns.

Do not be sad that roses have thorns, but rejoice that the thorns have roses.

Before the rose knows it, it is an old hip.

Like the raisin at the end of a sausage.

Rats don't thrive in a deserted house.

Rats leave a sinking ship and a burning house.

You can't fool an old rat.

It is better to be handy with your purse than bandy in your legs.

It takes a broad back to carry good days.

The fox is sly, it doesn't step on its own tail.

When the fox praises the raven, it loses its cheese.

Don't let a fox in the henhouse.

Old foxes don't walk into rusty traps.

He is as sly as a fox.

He is up to something.
 
You can't straddle two horses with one ass.
