-  Yes, you do.  Couldn't you be my guy, Hare, if I was old enough and if you wanted?

-  Of course.  You are my girl.

-  Am I really your girl?

-  Of course.

-  Do you love me?

-  Mmm.

-  Will you always love me?

-  Of course.

-  Will you come over and watch me play indoors?

-  Maybe.

-  Oh, Hare, you don't love me.  Because if you loved me, you would come over and watch me play indoors.


Hemingway can write this sort of thing, so it is superfluous to write how old the girl is or that the problem is not what they are talking about - whether he loves or does not love his sister - but why he is not loved by those he wants to be loved by.  Dialogue with subtext, and a clearly defined narrative point of view, these two devices were part of the prose of impressionism.  Imagism augmented the prose with a new type of subtext, the compositional.  Hemingway described it early and late with the image of an iceberg.
