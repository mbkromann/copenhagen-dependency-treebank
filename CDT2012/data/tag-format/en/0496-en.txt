For Søs Krusell, 16 years old, the project has meant something quite special. 

She wants to apprentice as a metal worker. 

"I had never imagined that.  But I like working with a lathe and a milling machine, where it is a matter of being exact, so the product is perfect, " she says.


Danfoss apprentices 

Eight selected Danfoss apprentices have guided the 12 school students through the production of the weather station.  Along the way, the apprentices have had responsibility for each their own group.  Every Friday, the students have received an individual assessment of the work efforts for the week. 
h"In the beginning, the boys especially were noisy and fooled around in the workshop.  So, we had to just make them understand that you cannot mess around among the machines. But today I believe they have done the job well.  None of them knew how a lathe looked.  Today, they all calmly and naturally go over to the lathe and work, " says the apprentice in charge,
Bjarne Hansen.


Soft subjects

The idea man behind the project between Danfoss, the Royal Danish School of Education Studies and the Humlehøj School is 11th-grade Danish teacher, Jens Peter Thestrup.
