Sports does not deserve this "hot dog tax", which "No. 742" must be viewed as.

For example, at the Nibe Football Club, where, in connection with home matches for senior teams, they sell red hotdogs and coffee from the cafeteria: Regulatory fee DKK 1,500.

Or at the clubhouse at Riisvangen Stadium in Ã…rhus.  Here, the members can gorge themselves on soda, hotdogs, toast or a little candy: Regulatory fee DKK 6,000.

Countless other examples could be mentioned.  The above also illustrates what they generally call rule confusion.  The size of the fee depends entirely on the category into which the relevant "food establishment" is placed.  In most instances, it is the local food control unit that undertakes the placement about which may be appealed. 

That is happening already in many instances.  Large trade associations have even encouraged members to send in written objections to the size of the fee.

One of the points of objection from business circles has been that they are not able to pay the fee after profit.  Instead, they have put a higher weight on factors such as size and kitchen activity.
