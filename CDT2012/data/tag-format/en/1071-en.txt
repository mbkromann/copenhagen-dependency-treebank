From poetry to drama F.P.Jac has jumped from poetry to drama and is also testing his strength at the Radio Theatre for the first time.  Lone Scherfig, who participated in a project "Ether Drama" in the spring, has directed his comedy What a Shame for Dora.  It is about a musician Louis with his capsized career and his wife Dora, who must take on a bit of everything.  As an attempt at some sort of reconciliation between the two spouses, they go on a charter trip to Germany.  In the meantime, their two teenage daughters almost turn their home upside down.

Willumsen's solitude

It is far from a debut but rather a reappearance after a long absence that the Radio Theatre is able to present Dorrit Willumsen's Out of the Picture 17 years after she last wrote for radio theatre.

Henrik Sartou directs the drama about the yuppie couple, their parents and the mystical young man.

"It's about the fact that solitude and the longing for love live ever in us and are doing fine," says the director.
