"After almost 30 years in the private labor market, it was hard, when I was let go in April as senior assistant from Novenco as a result of cutbacks.  I've tried applying for a lot of jobs, but everywhere I've received the answer 'regrettably ?,'" says 43-year-old Steen Petersen, who used his involuntary availability to help his wife, when her four day-care children wanted to play or go for a walk.

"A couple of weeks ago, the supervisor of the day-care centre suggested that I apply for a position, which had become available.  I thought, "why not?"  While I was spending time at home, I realized that looking after other people's children really is a job," says Steen Petersen, who in the future, among other things, will be changing diapers up to 15 times a day.

"Yes, Steen and many others have always believed that looking after children was something you did at home and had a good time with.  It has not been counted as real work," says day-care worker Lene Petersen.
