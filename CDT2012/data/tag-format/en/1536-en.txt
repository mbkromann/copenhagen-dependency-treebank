"I've got chills down my back all the time.  I'm afraid many have been killed," said a spokesman for the police, Klaaf Wilting.

The accident took place at dinner time around 6:45 p.m. last night, shortly after the El-Al flight with three crew members and a woman passenger on board lifted off from Amsterdam's Schiphol airport.

The pilot suddenly reported to the control tower that he had engine problems and was forced to turn around for an emergency landing at Schiphol.

"I saw the plane with its nose pointing downward, the left wing up and the right wing down over behind the flat building.  Smoke was coming out of the engines.  The pilot attempted to right the plane - then I could not see more, but suddenly there were sparks in the air," says eyewitness Peter de Neef.

At Schiphol airport, the airplane management in the control tower followed the dramatic developments with horror.

"They could see a huge fireball," says an employee from the Dutch airline company, KLM.

The cause of the engine problems was unknown last night.
