He came to Denmark as an 11-year old in 1976.  Like so many others, he has lived in Taastrupgård since he came here.  He worked as a fitter at a factory until he started a pizzeria in Nyhavn two years ago, along with his brother.

He does not intend to remaining living in Taastrupgård.  When he is asked why, he does not hesitate with a reply:

"Too many immigrants live there."

He hastens to add that he does not have anything against immigrants, he also has friends among them.

"But you can look round at others here, only the fewest of them speak Danish."

Nor do they need to.

"They speak Turkish at home, they speak Turkish here, they speak Turkish at work, they can see Turkish television, and it ends up that you forget Danish."

And for him, there is a clear connection between being able to speak Danish and being able to do well in Danish society.
