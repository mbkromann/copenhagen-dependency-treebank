Police drove around with loudspeakers on the car roof to ask citizens to remain inside with the windows shut, when Faaborg Shipyard yesterday experienced a major fire.

A thick black smoke poured out of the shipyard's casting house over Faaborg and could be seen and smelled miles from the town.  Particles of soot fell to the ground over a radius of 15 kilometres from the southern Funen town.

The smoke came from glass fibre and polyester materials, burnt paint and chemicals and can, according to chief practitioner A. B. Larsen, Faaborg Hospital, have insidious harmful health effects, in which the symptoms do not appear until many hours later.

"Anyone who has been close enough to the fire to able to smell it risks incurring fluid in the lungs within 24 hours.  Without treatment, this condition can be life-threatening," says A. B. Larsen to Berlingske Tidende.

Despite police warnings and blockades, residents of southern Funen flocked to the harbour in Faaborg to get a glimpse of the fire.  Also extra bulletins on the Radio News asked people to stay away.
