Houmark's beautiful play 

And so the Strayhorn repertoire may also make the listener recognise the Ellington saxophonist Paul Gonsalves in Henderson's dry, textural and very woodwind-like timbre.  Yet, in a freer (among other ways, in tempo) playing style and repertoire, drums and melodic instrument are able to do quite well alone - if, that is, you possess as unusual a talent as Marilyn Mazur.  This also appears in the telling title number Follow Me, Follow You on guitarist Karsten Houmark's new CD, in which trumpeter Uli Beckerhoff, the conductor himself and bassist Arild Andersen in turn open up in an interplay with Mazur, whose fascinating, flighty fluttering trumpet play is clearly influenced by experiences from her rather mixed percussion arsenal - which could also be heard, when the group played at the Copenhagen Jazzhouse on Friday.  She also makes use of this on the record's other numbers, where Alex Riel takes over the drums.  In addition, the British singer Norma Winstone appears on two numbers - and, on a single cut, pianist Thomas Clausen.
