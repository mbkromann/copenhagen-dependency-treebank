"Okay, we'll meet at 2:00 p.m. tomorrow at the usual place."

Cryptic, tapped telephone conversations and meetings at pubs between old, criminal acquaintances were, according to "Lonne", Leon Erling Fristrup Jensen, 44, arrested on drug-related charges, only about getting him a hotdog stand!

"Lonne" claimed yesterday in the Eastern High Court, where he is charged as one of the principals in a league of Danes who, according to the police, have smuggled kilos of heroin in from Pattaya, Thailand, to Denmark.

The prosecution service believes that a number of telephone conversations and meetings in October and November 1991 show that "Lonne" in collaboration with an old friend, a former big-time smuggler and now hotdog vendor in Copenhagen, and an expatriate Dane in Pattaya planned the operation to smuggle heroin from Thailand.

The expatriate Dane with a propensity for gold jewellery has for many years run a pub in Pattaya.  But he is now among the three Danes, who have voluntarily come home from Thailand for pre-trial detention in Denmark, because they otherwise risked being thrown into a Thai jail in anticipation of extradition to Denmark.
