tag files

1 id attribute
each <W> has an id that is equal to one less than the line number in
the file (maybe this can be ignored)

2 in and out links
each link is of this form [offset]:[name]
if id n has an in link with offset o and name n, then there must be an
out link for id n+o with offset o*-1 with the same name

links are surrounded by double quotes, delimited by |

3 msd and tag attributes
i think tag is a more general form of msd, so tag should be derivable
from msd
both msd and tag should be selected from a fixed set of possibilities

4 lemma 
could check that lemma is a valid choice for the given token




atag files


alignfile must exist
align 
out and in attributes look like this: a43, where a is the key of an
alignfile, and 43 is an id in that file

so if there is an out attribute a43, then in file a, there must be a W
with id 43 whose value is equal to the outsign in the alignfile. if
there is an in attribute b1, then in file b, there must be a W with id
1 whose value is equal to the insign in the alignfile.
