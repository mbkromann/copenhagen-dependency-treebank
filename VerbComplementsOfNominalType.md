## Verb Complements Of Nominal Type ##

### Noun complements: subjects, direct objects, indirect objects, and predicatives ###

Noun complements can be phrases headed by pronouns, common nouns, type-shifted adjectives, and gerunds; infinitival and sentential constructions headed by the special pronoun "at"; and embedded wh-questions headed by interrogative pronouns like "om", "hvem", "hvorn√•r", "hvorfor", etc.

Verbs may license four different kinds of noun complements: ''subjects'' ('subj'), ''direct objects'' ('dobj'), ''indirect objects'' ('iobj'), and ''predicatives'' ('pred'). Verbs must license exactly one subject ('subj') or expletive subject ('expl'), and never license more than one noun complement of each type -- in particular, [expletives](http://copenhagen-dependency-treebank.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/#_expl) turn subjects into direct objects. Licensed noun complements are always optional, ie, they are not necessarily realized when the verb is actually used.  For instance the following sentence licenses a subject, but does not realize it:

Noun complements should not be confused with the different kinds of noun adjuncts that a verb may have: [external topics](http://copenhagen-dependency-treebank.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/#_xtop) ('xtop'), [vocatives](http://copenhagen-dependency-treebank.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/#_voc) ('voc'), and [parenthetical appositions](http://copenhagen-dependency-treebank.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/nounsT.html#_appaV) ('appa').

Verbal complements of modal or auxiliary verbs share the subject via a subject filler dependency (see our analysis of [raising](http://copenhagen-dependency-treebank.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/#raising)):

Different noun complement roles can be disambiguated with the following linguistic tests:

  * **subj vs dobj**: (1) question test, (2) modal verb test, (3) adverbial test, (4) case marking test, (6) expletive test
  * **subj vs iobj**: (1) question test, (2) modal verb test, (3) adverbial test, (4) case marking test
  * **subj vs pred**: (1) question test, (2) modal verb test, (3) adverbial test, (4) case marking test
  * **dobj vs iobj**: (1) question test, (6) expletive test, (8) PP-paraphrase
  * **dobj vs pred**: (5) paradigm test, (6) expletive test, (7) agreement test
  * **iobj vs pred**: (5) paradigm test, (6) expletive test, (7) agreement test, (8) PP-paraphrase
