## Fillers ##

There are many constructions where a word has more than one governor, ie, both a primary governor and one or more secondary governors for which it provides a filler (semantic variable). For example, in the sentence "He has seen it", "he" is the subject of the main verb "has", but in some way also acts as subject for the subordinate verb "seen"; and in the sentence "This is the man we know", "the man" is the subject of "is", but in some way also acts as direct object of "know". In the treebank, we take a slightly simplified view where a word can have secondary dependencies (called ''filler dependencies'') that provide a "copy" (ie, semantic variable) of the word to the secondary governors. Filler dependencies are shown below the words, with a dependency label of the form "[''role'']". The square brackets indicate that the dependency is a filler dependency, and ''role'' states the dependency role the filler has in the secondary governor (eg, "[subj](subj.md)" denotes a subject filler dependency). Some examples of treebank analyses with filler dependencies are shown below:

Fillers are used in a wide range of constructions, including:

  * Verbal clusters where the subject must satisfy the subject role of several verbs.
  * Relative clauses where the relativized phrase must satisfy a dependency within the relative clause as well as an external dependency.
  * Raising and control (including perception verbs) where a dependent of the raising/control verb must satisfy a dependency role of the controlled verb.

The treebank analysis is a simplification of the analysis of fillers in [Discontinuous Grammar](http://copenhagen-dependency-treebank.googlecode.com/svn/dg). The treebank analysis is more intuitive than its counterpart in Discontinuous Grammar because it corresponds more directly to a semantic level, and less complicated because it replaces a phonetically empty node and two dependencies with one filler-dependency. However, from a technical point of view, the DG analysis is more precise because it accounts for the licensing conditions for fillers and their interaction with island constraints. The DG analysis does this by distinguishing between a phonetically empty ''filler'', a ''filler licensor'' that licenses the filler, and a ''filler source'' in the local neighbourhood of the filler licensor (ie, a neighbour of the filler licensor in the dependency graph) that is used as a forced antecedent for the filler. The three graphs below left show the technically precise DG analyses corresponding to the first three treebank graphs shown above. The "ref" dependency goes from the filler source to the filler, the "fill" dependency goes from the filler licensor to the filler. The fourth graph shows a relative clause where the filler's governor and licensor do not coincide.
