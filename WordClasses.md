## Word Classes ##

The PAROLE tagset contains three morphologically defined word classes:

  * **AN (normal adjective):** inflected in ''degree'' (positive, comparative, superlative), ''gender'' (commune, neuter), ''number'' (mass/singular, plural), ''definiteness'' (definite, indefinite)
  * **NC (common noun):** inflected in ''number'' (mass/singular, plural), ''definiteness'' (definite, indefinite)
  * **VA (verb):** inflected in ''form'' (present, past, infinitive, imperative, gerund, present participle, past participle), ''voice'' (active, passive)

Gerundium occurs with almost all verbs by addition of "+en" (eg, "skaben", "undren", "l√∏ben", "syngen", "laven mad"). The full PAROLE word class tagset for Danish is shown below:

  * **A**: adjectives
    * **AN**: normal adjective
    * **AC**: cardinals
    * **AO**: ordinals
  * **C**: conjunction
    * **CC**: coordinating conjunction
    * **CS**: subordinating conjunction
  * **I**: interjection
  * **N**: noun
    * **NP**: proper noun
    * **NC**: common noun
  * **P**: pronoun
    * **PP**: personal pronoun
    * **PD**: demonstrative pronoun
    * **PI**: indefinite pronoun
    * **PT**: interrogative/relative pronoun
    * **PC**: reciprocal pronoun
    * **PO**: possessive pronoun
  * **RG**: adverb

  * **U**: unique
  * **V**: verb
    * **VA**: main verb
    * **VE**: medial verb
  * **X**: extra-linguistic units

    * **XX**: other

Here is a graphical diagram of our organization of the PAROLE word classes (the word class CS is not recognized as a separate word class and its member words are mostly analyzed as prepositions). Moreover, cardinal adjectives are analyzed as cardinal numerals, a special group of pronouns.
