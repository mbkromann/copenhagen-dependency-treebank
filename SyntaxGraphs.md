## Syntax Graphs ##

The main idea in dependency theory is that syntactic structure can be described as a set of typed ''relations'' between ordered pairs of words: a main word (called a ''head'') and a subordinate word (called a ''subordinate''). The syntactic analysis is encoded as a graph containing labeled ''nodes'' (representing words) and labeled directed ''edges'' (representing relations between words). Different levels of syntactic structure are encoded with different types of relations:

  * **surface relations (landing):** relations between landing sites and landed nodes, and filler licensors and fillers.
  * **deep relations (dependency):** relations between governors and their complements and adjuncts.
  * **anaphoric relations (reference):** relations between antecedents and anaphora that encode semantic coreference.
