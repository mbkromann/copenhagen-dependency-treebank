## Mass And Count Nouns ##

**Mass and count nouns:** It is often assumed that nouns are either count nouns, mass nouns or ambiguous between the two readings. However, while there is clearly a semantic difference between the mass reading (unindividuated) and the count reading (individuated), there is good reason to argue that all nouns are ambiguous between the two readings. This view is supported by the observation that even nouns that are traditionally classified as count nouns, have a mass reading. While the mass reading of some nouns (traditional "count nouns") may be semantically implausible in many contexts, it is usually possible to construct a context that will make the mass reading plausible for any given noun. The noun "corner" was suggested by Richard Hudson (personal correspondence) as the ultimate challenge, but even that seems to have a mass reading:

  * A: What part of the cake do you like? B: I like corner more than top.
  * I would like to eat shark.
  * I want idea more than feeling.

Similarly, the count readings of other nouns (traditional "mass nouns") are semantically implausible in many contexts, but one rarely sees mass nouns that do not have a corresponding individuated count reading:

  * The wines just arrived.
  * The sands of Sahara.
  * The waters were divided.
  * The beers are delicious.

Thus, we do not see any need to distinguish between two classes of nouns, "count nouns" and "mass nouns". Rather, we believe that all nouns have a mass reading which may be type-shifted to a count reading by an external semantic operator provided by a plural morpheme or certain determiners.
