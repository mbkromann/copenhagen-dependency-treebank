## The Danish preposition "rundt" ##

**RUNDT** Can behave as a preposition, when "rundt" occurs with a locational meaning:

  * De kørte **landet rundt**

as opposed to a time-indicating meaning:

  * De fester **året rundt**

The reasons for choosing a different analysis for the locational and time-indicating meanings are:

  * You can paraphrase the locational "De kørte landet rundt" to "De kørte rundt i landet" or to "De kørte rundt"; this indicates that "rundt" is the more important part of the phrase "landet rundt", and therefore "rundt" should be the head of the phrase.
  * You can paraphrase the time-indicating "De fester året rundt" to "De fester hele året" or "De fester året igennem"; this indicates that "året" is the more important part of the phrase "året rundt", and therefore "året" should be the head of the phrase.
