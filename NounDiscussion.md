## Noun Discussion ##

Noun phrases have been analyzed in many different ways in the literature. The main division lines are: Should constructions with a pronoun and a common noun be headed by the common noun or the pronoun (NP or DP analysis)? Should all noun phrases be analyzed uniformly as NPs or DPs, by positing phonetically empty nouns or determiners if they are absent? Should adjectives be analyzed as dependents of the pronoun or the common noun (if both are present)? Should we distinguish between mass nouns and count nouns?
