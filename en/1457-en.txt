"Look straight ahead.  Don't look at me.  Drive the way you're told," were the gunman's orders.

With the pistol aimed at his head, the postal driver was directed out along Enghavevej Road, past the South Harbour S-station towards the Zealand bridge.

Shortly before the bridge, he was told to drive onto Bådehavnsgade and down Speditørvej, which dead-ends at a fence facing an open area.

GUNMAN TOOK HIMSELF

The gunman forced his hostage out of the car, where he received orders to unlock the delivery van's sliding door.

"Thank you, now I know myself what I have to do," said the gunman, taking a sealed postal bag and an insured parcel out of the car.

The driver was again forced into the car and told to lie down on top of the bags and not to look up, before the robber was gone.

The shocked driver was just able to see the gunman disappear through a hole in the fence and run into the deserted, open area.  Then, he raised the alarm over his radio to headquarters in Tietgensgade, where an alarm was raised with the police at 5:48 pm.
