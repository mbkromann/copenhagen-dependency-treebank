The flooring must be sturdy and easy to keep clean.  No place else in the house is the floor exposed to so much soiling with grease and dirt as in the kitchen.  At the same time, the floor must also be pleasant to stand and walk on for extended periods of time.

A wood floor is sufficiently pliant, so that your legs do not get tired, even after a long period of walking and standing.  But an untreated or lye-treated wood floor does not belong in the kitchen.  It will absorb all the fat stench like blotting paper and, after a short time, the result will be a floor that looks sad and dingy, because the spots are not easy to remove again.  If, on the other hand, you choose a varnished wood floor, you get around this problem.

Linoleum has been used as kitchen flooring for many years and has stood the test with flying colours.

Linoleum can be found in whole sheets and as tiles.  In a single colour or flecked version.  It is pleasant to walk on and easy to keep clean by washing it with soapy water.  Linoleum is also well-suited to the kitchen table and countertops.
