He quickly got hold of DTM and learned that one must handle the equipment with a certain amount of care in order to spare the car.  It is not enough to be up front in the start - it is a matter of getting to the chequered flag at the end.

I have difficulty seeing that Kurt has any weaknesses at all as a race car driver.


Kurt on the race car driver Kris:

-  Kris is a very serious race car driver, whose will to win is incredibly deep - he is a type who wants to win.  An inestimable quality for a race car driver.  At the same time, he is very fair on the track, and I can't think of having any "problems" with him during training or in races.

It is fantastic he has overcome so much this year: The first three-quarters of the DTM season with the private Unitron team, where, in addition to being driver, he was also supposed to "organise" a lot of things.  Then, he established Team Hokspeed for the Nordic Cup and, in the middle of it all, he switched over to Prodrive's BMW factory team in the English championship.
