Doskocil Cos. said its bank-debt payments have been extended until May 31 , 1990 , to give it more time to sell its Wilson Foods Corp. retail and fresh meat operations .
The company was to repay $ 58 million in debt on Dec. 31 and $ 15 million on March 31 .
The company acquired the debt when it paid $ 155 million to purchase Wilson last year .
An agreement to sell the Wilson assets for $ 150 million in cash and notes collapsed in late September , when the buyer , a company controlled by George Gillett , could n't secure financing .
