Thus, months of uncertainty about the status of the two republics in international law ended, and the old Yugoslavia ceased to exist for everyone other than Serbs, who late last summer had conducted war against the Croatians.

The EC's other member states, including Denmark, likewise recognised Croatia and Slovenia yesterday.  "But they let the Germans do the dirty work," commented a Croatian official, when the champagne corks flew through the air and Bonn's special envoy, Klaus-Peter Klaiber, exchanged handshakes with Croatia's President Franjo Tudjman.

The official alluded to the pressure Germany had for the last six months put on more reluctant EC members, such as Great Britain, France and Greece, to recognise the two republics.  Nor was Denmark in the beginning especially enthusiastic, and yesterday the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Copenhagen avoided sending an ambassador to Croatia and Slovenia with the same speed as was done in the fall with the recognition of the Baltic countries.

The satisfaction - and self-satisfaction - of the Croatians and Slovenians, however, was untarnished.  In the ballroom in Zagreb, President Tudjman's cabinet head Hrvoje Sarinc threw himself into an extensive praise of his country and its "successful and realistic policies."
