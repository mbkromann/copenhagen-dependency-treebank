That is what the homicide department in Copenhagen now believes, that the bombing attack against the International Socialists happened at 11:32 on Monday.

Technical experts have now established that the explosion was due to a very powerful bomb, and everything indicates that the bomb was delivered by the postman, who at 8:45 on Monday put the thick sample envelope in the post-box of the "International Socialists".

BOMB CRATER

"The table surface on the desk was pulverised, and the bomb has made a deep crater in the floor below.  This speaks for the bomb exploding, when he opened the package," says Chief Criminal Superintendent Bent Hansen, homicide department.

The police technicians have not found the remains of the bomb yet, but kilos of material, which have accumulated at the scene, must now be fine-sorted and examined.

Yesterday, police technicians held a meeting with explosives experts from the Farum Barracks' engineering corps, but the police cannot yet say what explosive was used.  But it must be an explosive that also has a powerful incendiary effect.

Today, there will a new meeting with other explosives experts in an attempt to ascertain the type of explosive.
