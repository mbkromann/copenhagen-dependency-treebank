The adoption of the resolution is the UN's most far-reaching move to date in the war, and it is the first time that the Security Council has given the green light to military actions in connection with the humanitarian task.

If Serbia refuses to comply with the warning, the current plans are to open a corridor by land to Sarajevo and other areas which are under siege by enemy forces.

In Croatia's capital Zagreb, the Danish head of the UN refugee organization (UNHCR), Lars Lynge Nielsen, said yesterday evening to Ritzau's Bureau that the UNHCR believes that the great international attention on ethnic cleansing in Bosnia-Herzegovina has shaken the Serbian leaders in the republic.

"We have deliberately told everything we have seen to the press.  And the great media coverage of especially the Serbian attempts to throw Muslims and Croats out of Serbian-controlled regions has shaken the Serbs," said Lynge Nielsen.

He has in recent days negotiated with the Serbian leaders and made it clear that the UNHCR will not be part of moving just under 30,000 Muslims out of Bosnia-Herzegovina and into Croatia or the areas protected by the UN.
