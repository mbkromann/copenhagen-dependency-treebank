"Anders had a completely different disposition from my own son.  It irritated me that the boy cried so much, so that I wanted to shake him up.  I must have hit harder than I thought and been unlucky.  His eyes began to roll and his neck went loose."

He became nervous, when the child began to rasp for breath, and called for an ambulance:

"I also called his father and said there is something terribly wrong - the boy had gotten cramps."
