He was to be 72 years old, before he got his breakthrough to the general public with the album "The Healer".

His name is John Lee Hooker, born August 22, 1917, in the home state of blues music, Mississippi.

And he did not get his decisive breakthrough until 1989, when he received a Grammy for "The Healer", but lovers of, for example, Johnny Winter, Status Quo, Animals, Georgia Satellites, ZZ Top, The Black Crowes and Rolling Stones' guitarist Keith Richards can now just quietly prostrate themselves and give hearty and intense thanks that John Lee Hooker came into the world back in 1917.

John Lee Hooker's influence on other musicians as singer and especially as guitarist has been no less than monumental.  Lee Hooker invented the cool, swinging boogie guitar style on which Keith Richards and guitarists Francis Rossi and Rick Parfitt of Status Quo have lived high and well through four decades.  And what is more: he invented the style back in the 40s.
