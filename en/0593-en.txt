A rent allowance may be sought by all retired persons - both single and married, where one or both spouses are retired.  The rent allowance is tax-free.

The rent allowance is calculated with a starting point in the amount of the rent, the income of the household, the size of the apartment, and the size and composition of the household.  With respect to the calculation of the rent allowance, the starting point is taken in the so-called threshold amount.  The threshold amount is for incomes that do not exceed approximately DKK 130,000 in 1992 11 2/3 % of the household income.  The rent allowance in 1992 amounts to 93 1/3 % of the difference between your estimated threshold amount and your rent.

Note that if the gross floorage of your residence exceeds 65 sq.m. and you live alone in the apartment, you will have your rent allowance reduced for the first 20 surplus square metres to 57% of the cost per sq.m.  If your residence exceeds 85 sq.m., your rent allowance will be reduced to 50% of the cost per sq.m. for the surplus sq.m.  If the floorage limits are exceeded because, for example, your spouse or co-habitee has died or your spouse or co-habitee has been taken to a nursing home, the surplus will have no influence on your rent allowance.
