The EC countries have, as Pia Kjærsgaard must be aware, worked together for a number of years on the immigration and asylum policy, and this collaboration has, among other things, resulted in the EC Asylum Convention, which determines which state is responsible for the handling of an asylum application that is submitted in an EC member country.  When the convention becomes effective, one will, for example, be able to prevent asylum-seekers from submitting an application to several countries at the same time, since the application can only be handled by one country.  This means that an asylum-seeker, who has first submitted his application to, for example, Portugal or Spain, cannot as claimed by Pia Kjærsgaard simply decide to come to Denmark and have an asylum application handled here.

THAT will be the result of this convention, which the EC countries have drawn up as a part of their collaboration in the area of immigration and asylum.  But it has nothing to do with the Union Treaty.  What is new in the Union Treaty is that the collaboration already in existence on immigration and asylum policy will find a place within the framework of the treaty.  There is still talk of inter-state co-operation, but the EC countries have now expressed their desire to include this issue in the treaty as an issue of common interest.
