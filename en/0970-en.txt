"If there is the necessary political will both to build anew and to appropriate money for operations, then a separation of the drama division from the Kgs. Nytorv will be a natural result."

The drama head also has a clear answer to the proposal of several actors to name her the new theatre head:

"No, thank you.  Not at the Royal Theatre."

Has a deadline of December 1

The national stage's new board, which in its first conspicuous action has fired Boel Jørgensen, has been given a deadline of December 1 by the Minister for Culture Grethe Rostbøll (Cons.) to make a proposal on the future structure of the Royal Theatre.  The first step was taken at an extended board meeting the day before Whitsun.

The playhouse is also on the agenda in a new committee cutting across the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Environment, with permanent secretary Michael Christiansen from the Ministry of Defence as chairperson.  The committee is working at the moment on several concrete proposals of which a new playhouse is a part.

The proposals include, among other things, building plans at Holmen and the harbour front, and several sources estimate that there will be an initiative from the committee during the fall.
