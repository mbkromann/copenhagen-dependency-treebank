The situation is that Lars Olsen still has the final year left of his contract with Trabzonspor.

But nevertheless the papers are teeming with reports that the captain of the national team was on his way to one of Istanbul's three top clubs, Besiktas, Fenerbache or Galatasaray.

"I don't put much stock in this shower of rumours," says Lars Olson to B.T.

"We are in the middle of the most hectic "trading period" in Turkish football.  Everybody is guessing everything about everybody.  I probably only discover a few of all the rumours myself, because I only rarely buy a Turkish paper for the TV programmes.

Last weekend, my club- and roommate suddenly asked me why I wanted to play French football.  It turned out that a paper claimed to know that French Lyon, whom we beat in the second Europe Cup round last fall, was supposed to be interested in me.

But I said: My fixed standpoint has got to be my contract for yet another year in Trabzonspor, where I am also very happy to be."
