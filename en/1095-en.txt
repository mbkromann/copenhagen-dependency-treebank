Conditions were horrifying in the DDR's only closed juvenile prison, located in Torgau on the Elbe.

60 children between 14 and 18 were locked up here, because according to the regime they had demonstrated a high degree of asocial behaviour and proved themselves incorrigible at more normal youth institutions.

Behind high walls with barbed wire, the "educators", who in reality were prison guards, gave outlet to their sadistic inclinations.  The accounts of how the children were mistreated are hair-raising.  

According to an official report from the city government, conditions in the prison were significantly worse than in normal DDR prisons for adults.  The material is based in part on documents, which the prison's management was unable to destroy in time, in part on statements of witnesses.

Many children tried to escape the horrors by suicide attempts or by inflicting injuries upon themselves in order to get into a hospital.  One boy stuck an iron bar up his rectum.  Another set fire to himself.  Others swallowed nails and pieces of glass or cut their veins.
