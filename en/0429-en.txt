In Eastern Europe, people are kept ignorant in a humiliating way unknown to us.  That much of the "information" we are offered in our motley media, on the other hand, is degrading, that is another discussion.  The lack of information and disinformation are factors that, in part, make passive and, in part, give rise to myths about the West, and finally, in part, create an inclination simply to make people believe the opposite of what they read in the party press.  There are no vagabonds sleeping beneath the bridges in Paris, impossible, such as the Poles could see in a television broadcast.  No, no, the state television must be way off the mark with that.  The Poles didn't buy it.  It had to be extras.

But in the West?  Hungarian Gy√∂rgy Dalos, who has written a satire "Gullasch Archipelago" and now lives in the West, is amazed at how much ignorance there is here:

-  If you take into consideration that Western society is praised for being an information society where all relevant information is at one's disposal, you are surprised again and again about the lack of knowledge about the most elemental matters in Eastern Europe.
