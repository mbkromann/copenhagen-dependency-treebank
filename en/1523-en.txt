Several of the next of kin of the murderer's victims also went amok after the sentencing.

"Give him to us, let us have him," shouted the desperate mother, Lydia Khobotova, as she tried to push her way past the guards in front of Chikatilo, who brutally murdered her 10-year old son.

LET US HAVE HIM

Nina Belovetskaya's 12-year old son Vanya was also killed by the sadistic schoolteacher.

"He should be taught a lesson for all the horrors he has committed.  We should take care of him right here in the courtroom.  I would personally liquidate him," said Nina Belovetskaya.

The judge Leonid Akubzhanov placed great emphasis on the fact that the mass murderer had carefully and cynically planned and executed his gruesome crimes - and afterwards cleaned up any revealing evidentiary material.

Often, the schoolteacher carried a map and an extra set of clothes, so that he could change, if he met a victim and got blood on his clothes.  He also arranged business trips with the sole purpose of tracking down suitable victims.
