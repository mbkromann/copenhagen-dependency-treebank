In the swimming pool, 30 women are standing in water up to their chests.

In five rows with ropes stretched from edge to edge as support, they follow intently the commands of the exercise instructor.

The resistance in the water increases the effect of their movements.  Movements that, for most of them, it would not have been possible to take without risk of joint or muscle damage.  Because they are overweight.

Or, purely and simply, fat and obese to a greater or lesser degree, as one person puts it.

They are embarrassed by their appearance and would not dream of displaying themselves in a swimming hall, where the beanstalks stare and the prying glances burn a hole in the back of their necks.

"You can almost see that some of those thin madams with polished red nails are thinking: Jee-zus," says the 25-year old Bettina JÃ¸rgensen from Hammel.  Her weight has always swung up and down, but after a pregnancy it went completely off the rails.

She has tried to go to ordinary adult swimming classes, but could not accept feeling that she was being stared at.
