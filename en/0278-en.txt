Rudbjerg  -  With the formation of the Volleyball Club in Nakskov recently, there are now two volleyball clubs in Western Lolland.  And since both clubs have problems getting coaches and players, a collaboration between the two clubs seems obvious.


Rudbjerg IF's male team has prospects of becoming the first male team from Lolland-Falster in the 2nd division.  And if they move up, there could easily be a need for talented players from other clubs.


-  They have a lot of talented young players in Nakskov.  And when they get hungry, they'll come out to us, where they can play division volleyball.  But the solution over the longer term is quite clearly to merge the clubs, says Gerner Jørgensen, chairman for Rudbjerg IF.


Coach in Nakskov


-  I coach a female team in Nakskov and have, at one time, helped start the game there, says René Thauner, who mentions that Gerner Jørgensen is also a trainer in Nakskov.
