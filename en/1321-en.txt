"I think it is great that Stefan Rasmussen is receiving this fine distinction for his efforts.  It is absolutely something to be proud of," says the chairman of the Danish Pilot Association, Eigil Kragh.

The price of Stefan Rasmussen's tremendous efforts in the emergency landing, however, is that he in all probability will never again sit at the helm of a cockpit, because he does not feel ready once again to take responsibility for airplane passengers.  But Stefan Rasmussen need not fret over this economically.

He is - like all other SAS pilots - covered by insurance, and it is no small change Stefan Rasmussen can look forward to, if his pilot's license is revoked by the Danish airline authorities.

THE LICENSE INSURED

First of all, he will receive a half a million crowns in a one-time payment, because he is covered under what is called "loss of licence" (loss of license).  This one-time payment is made to any Danish SAS pilot who loses his licence for medical reasons.
