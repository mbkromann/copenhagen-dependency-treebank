But let the doctor decide that.  The testicles are generally quite sensitive.  A hard blow or a kick can be so painful that you pass out.

Diseases such as the mumps or gonorrhea make the testicles painful.  If a testicle rotates, gets twisted, the blood supply will be cut off.  This can destroy the testicle, and you should immediately find a doctor or go to the emergency room.

Some can feel pain in the testicles during intense sexual arousal.  An ejaculation in some form or another can naturally alleviate the problem.  If a testicle suddenly begins to grow, you must immediately go to a doctor.  There may be a rupture or a cyst.  But there could also be a malignant tumor that must be removed by an operation.  

Sincerely yours, Janette.

Finding new places to make love

Dear Janette!

Do you have any good ideas about where people can make love?  I think it's so boring that it always takes place in bed in the bedroom.

It can be something untraditional.  We need inspiration, my darling girl and I.
