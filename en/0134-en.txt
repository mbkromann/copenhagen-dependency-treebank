A meeting yesterday between Frank Mathiesen and the players could not soften the battle lines.

Frank Mathiesen stuck to what he told B.T. the other day:

"The players will receive 20,000 a month in bonus.  But only in the case of an overall victory over Trabzonspor.

The concept of starting money we cannot accept on principle.

If we wash out against Trabzonspor - despite a satisfactory performance by the players - we might afterwards talk about an extraordinary payment.  Starting money or whatever it might be."

Captain Pierre Larsen declared after yesterday's unproductive meeting that the players will take note of management's decision.

"We thought management would propose new negotiations and a new constructive dialogue.

However, that was not the case.  Now, we have to think things through seriously with a view toward getting amended the nearly eight-year old riders that give management the right to act the way it is done.

MATTER OF PRINCIPLE

The experienced Ivan Nielsen, who is one of the most energetic of the rebels and proponents for amendments to the infamous riders in force, is in agreement with his captain.
