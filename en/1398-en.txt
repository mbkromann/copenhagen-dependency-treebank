So much more disturbing is the Bosnian ambush, in which some of the Serbian soldiers who were supposed to have been exchanged for the president lost their lives.

The two events will probably draw the outline of a continuing pattern of ethnic revolt, which is now blazing up in several of the former socialist countries.

In this specific case, of course, the federal army bears the responsibility for having provoked the situation with its grotesque seizure of the Bosnian president, when he landed in Sarajevo on Saturday after discussions with the government of the EC chairman country Portugal.

However, even in the federal army, people apparently realise that no modern society's governmental organs can turn a deaf ear to the reactions of the world - 

least of all societies whose futures are dependent on help from the outside.

Understandably enough, this perspective takes a back seat for the partisans, who see the federal army as an intolerable relic of the regime that has, for generations, stood for Serbian oppression of the national independence of the other Yugoslavian peoples.
