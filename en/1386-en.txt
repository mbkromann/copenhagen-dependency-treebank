TERRIBLY AFRAID

"It is so appalling as to be incomprehensible," says a mother of two, who lives in the Tronneallé neighbourhood.

"My own son of seven is terribly afraid of the boy in question.  He does not dare go alone to the bus.  Some of us almost haven't dared to send the children out to play for the same reason.  There are also some who have threatened to move, indeed, one resident has moved for the same reason."

It is presumed that the 11-year old was playing in the sand box with little Stewart just before the horrifying strangulation occurred.

Furthermore, he is presumed to have seen his chance to get the two-year old away from there - and a couple of hundred metres down to the grassy area with relatively high grass behind the building.  But he denies this.

Apparently, no one saw the two children go to the place where Stewart was presumably strangled; but shortly after, the calm midday quiet was broken by running steps, shocked outcries and wailing ambulance sirens, when Falck was called.
