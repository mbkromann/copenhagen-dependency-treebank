At the end of June, the Danish industrial firms, corrected for seasonal swing, employed over 270,000 people.  That is 38,000 fewer than at the height of the boom in 1986.

It will be a long time before industry can once again indulge in hopes of creating 53,000 new jobs in three years, as happened from 1983-86.  Experiences from that time also indicate that industrial employment first began to rise the year after economic growth had gotten started.

The general experience is that the need for more goods in an economic upturn at the start can be filled without an increase of business machinery and the number of employees.

Thus, industry's six-month data from Statistics Denmark also shows today that industrial firms at the beginning of the year's second half have a remaining employment capacity of 20 percent, which must be reduced first before the businesses need to expand during an economic upturn.

Likewise, a majority of the largest industrial businesses state that the volume of orders is below normal.  At the same time, stocks of raw goods as well as finished goods are somewhat above normal.
