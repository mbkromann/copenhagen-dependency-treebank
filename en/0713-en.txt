As a film photographer, Henning Camre often worked together with Jørgen Leth, it led to the films "The Perfect Human", "The Good and the Bad" and "Memos on Love," as well as a close friendship.

In 1975, Henning Camre was named director of the National Film School of Denmark, and it is this position he is now leaving for the distinguished post in England.  Here, he has the opportunity to continue working with the international ideas that have always absorbed him.  As leader of the Film School in Denmark, he helped bring it about that the director Gert Fredholm is now on his way to Zimbabwe to establish a film school.

Henning Camre does not devote his time to any hobby, he works hard out of desire, but hopes that, in England, he will be able to play a little more badminton.  It is not clear, when he will assume the new position.  There may be a leave arranged from the Film School, so he can have time to get his replacement established in the job.
