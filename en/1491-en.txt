Many thousands came along on the hunt for "Basse", because the police considered it a given that the kidnapper would sooner or later come into contact with the system.

It might happen in the form of a doctor's visit, vaccination, christening or baptism, but everything seemed to be in vain.

Suddenly, however, a surprising development occurred.  A 30-year old childless woman from Aalborg turned herself in to the police and confessed eight months after "Basse"'s kidnapping that she had thrown the boy in Odense Creek.

The confession, however, fell apart after a thorough interrogation by the police.  The woman had not even been in Odense at the time of the crime, and Anna BÃ¼rgel could at once breathe a sigh of relief and once again live in uncertainty about her son's fate.

Yet again, they had nothing to go on in the investigation, even though every conceivable force had been put in locally as well as nationally just after the kidnapping through the various authorities.

The police appealed yet again to the entire Danish population to keep their eyes and ears open and to look in summer houses and allotment garden houses for suspicious characters, but it helped just as little.
