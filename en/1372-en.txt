For four weeks in a row, they have remained in first place on Billboard in the US with the single "Jump", which came out in February.

It is not a new version of the Pointer Sisters' old hit, nor a remix of Van Halen's "Jump" number, but rather a completely new hip hop song, rapped by 12-year old Chris Smith and 13-year old Chris Kelly.

BEST FRIENDS

The two young men were born and grew up in Atlanta and met, when they started 1st grade.  At that time, they were not exactly friends, but it came gradually as they realised that they had several interests in common and, today, they are best friends.

"We are twins who do not look alike", says Smith.

One of their favourite activities is to take a walk in the park and philosophise a bit about life.

It was in the park, 19-year old producer Jermaine Dupri caught sight of them.

"They just had it," says Dupri.  "I knew they could become something big, so I went over and asked them whether they could rap."
