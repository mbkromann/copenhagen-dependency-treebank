Maribo Seeds is so far along in the hunt for the optimal sugar beet that the Danisco-owned Lolland business is certain that the beet will be in cultivators' fields before the year 2000.  Gene splicing of sugar beets has promoted the cause, and Maribo Seeds has just been granted an environmental permit to plant third-generation gene-spliced beets out in the experimental fields.

"But it is quite wrong that we must experiment so much in the laboratories, before we are granted a permit from the Environmental Protection Agency," says director  Leif Kjærgaard, Lic. Tech., who can certainly see ethical conflicts in altering the genes of animals, but not plants.  Leif Kjærgaard needs a production permit for the gene-spliced seeds within two years; otherwise, that part of the activity will stop among the 30 employees at the biotechnology laboratory in the Lolland division of Maribo Seeds.

In reality, all seed improvement is mutation.  With the traditional crossing methods, it takes 14-15 years to develop a new method, but with the gene-splicing technique, it can be done in eight-nine years, because you jump over some steps and discover more quickly whether a plant has the desired genes.
