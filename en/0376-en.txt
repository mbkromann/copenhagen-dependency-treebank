If everything goes according to the plans, 15 families can celebrate Christmas 1987 in their new co-op housing units on Stokkebjergvej in Jyderup.

After several years of preparation and several major meetings, 15 families have signed up to be a part of the housing co-op.

Now the people behind "Stokken" are only waiting for the housing co-op to become part of the residential quota before April 1987.

The construction is to be started no later than April 1987 in order to be ready by December 1987, says one of the originators, architect Flemming Østergaard, Jyderup.

-  Several of us have been a part of it since its start over two years ago.  Now something is going to happen.

The housing co-op has been on the waiting list at the Ministry of Housing for a year and a half, but Flemming Østergaard hopes and expects to receive a yes for 20 co-op housing units in Jyderup no later than the April quarter of 1987.

People are not waiting around for an answer with their hands in their laps.  A rough blueprint of the co-op housing units and a number of bylaws for the housing co-op exist.
