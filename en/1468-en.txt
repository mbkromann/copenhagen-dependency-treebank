Svendsen drives out there in the ambulance.  It is the most practical.  Because if he goes and fumbles with a mine, he has to go to the infirmary first, anyway.  And so, you might just as well have an ambulance out there at once.

GRUESOME PROCESS

The UN negotiator, former American Secretary of State Cyrus Vance's plan for the separation of the belligerent parties in what was once Yugoslavia is here put into practical field work by tank soldiers from the Jutland Dragoon Regiment, A-company, in UNPROFOR, the UN's peacekeeping forces in the newly-proclaimed, not-recognised republic of Kreijna.  Here, Tom Jensen and 120 comrades have set a boundary for war.  But the former Yugoslavia, which was carpented together by a strict hand of the Second World War partisan hero, Marshal Tito, did not take into consideration the population's ethnic boundaries.

Whereupon the groups in a liberated, satanic hatred, with murder, explosions, snipers and fire now implement their own mutual ethnic cleansing.  A gruesome process, to which the Danish UN soldiers have been eyewitnesses at close range.
