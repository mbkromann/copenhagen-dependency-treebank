The Chairperson for Parliament's Health Committee, Progress Party member Jan Køpke Christensen, said yesterday that, when Parliament convenes again, his party will put forth a proposal that a section be added to the Danish penal code which "clearly makes it illegal for HIV-infected persons consciously to infect others."

Jan Købke Christensen makes reference to the 34-year old Haitian who is charged with having consciously infected others with HIV.

SHORT OF MAJORITY 

But it does not at this point appear that a majority can be garnered for the proposal in Parliament.

"We will await the judgment against the Haitian suspect," says Elisabeth Arnold.

"There is nothing to indicate that he cannot be convicted pursuant to the two sections under which he is charged.  Namely, that he willfully inflicted grievous bodily harm on others and endangered the lives of others.  If he is convicted, an amendment of the penal code will be unnecessary, but if he is acquitted, it may be relevant.  However, my view is that it would be far more effective, if doctors would publicly declare that they will breach their duty of confidentiality," says Elisabeth Arnold.
