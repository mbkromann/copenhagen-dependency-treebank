In other words: smoking is forbidden in ministry cars!

Rebellion lurking

People in all ministries are trying these days to look at the matter from the positive side.  But you can sense that the conflicts and rebellion are lurking in the remarks Ekstra Bladet received, when we took the pulse yesterday on the fourth day of the smoke-free environments in government locales:

Ministry of the Environment:

-  We're going to discuss the matter now in our liaison committee.  It is not that we are proposing a conflict, but the ventilation in the ministry is already not too good.  (We shall not cite the names of people in any of the quotations.

Nerves are on edge as it is).

Ministry of Housing:

-  You should talk with 2nd office!

2nd office:

-  We're trying to adapt work and the office layout with respect to the circular. Yes, of course, we take it seriously and, thank God, nobody has made a fight of it yet.

The Ministry of State:

-  Yes, Poul has his own office, and he may smoke there.  In the front office, we have a smoker and a non-smoker.  We'll just have to figure it out.
