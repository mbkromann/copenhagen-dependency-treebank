The American election has gone into its decisive phase and, for people who claim that politics is a dirty business, there are lots of arguments to find in the way the three candidates are conducting themselves with each other.  Matters are not exactly being treated with kid gloves these days, since it is to be decided whether Democrat Bill Clinton really has a lead over the sitting president, Republican George Bush, and whether the independent Ross Perot can draw so many votes that he affects the result, which turns on the fact that the number one candidate in each state takes all the electoral votes.  These electoral mathematics say that you can be an American president without a majority.

Of the two major candidates, Bill Clinton has tried to make it into an issues-oriented election, based on the Republicans' tax and economic fiasco, while George Bush, on the other hand, has tried to make it character-oriented by putting strong question marks on Bill Clinton's suitability, first and foremost, on the basis of his draft resistance and opposition to the Vietnam war.
