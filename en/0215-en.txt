Let us imagine that, instead, local oil spill emergency services had sent out a single man with a tractor and a spray canister filled with gene-spliced bacteria designed to break down oil spills in cold salty water.  After a day, most of the oil would be gone.  The rest could be fixed with an extra spraying.  All the while, the long-term unemployed could watch videos or go for a walk with the dog.

This would be a conscious release of gene-spliced organisms into the nature.  And a Nordic scientific conference, which took place at Ingeni√∏rhuset in Copenhagen at the end of November, dealt with the issue.  But the title of the conference finished with the words "- and their effects on the environment", and therein arises the dilemma.  Can one be sure that bacteria or viruses, which are programmed to carry out a particular function in nature, for example, the destruction of oil spills, will also stick to that - and not begin to create chaos in natural ecosystems?  Or harm people and animals?
