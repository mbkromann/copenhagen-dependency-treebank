ODENSE: "It is completely meaningless and incomprehensible."

That is the way six female students at Odense University reacted yesterday after the murder of Betina Jørgensen Kjær, 20, at the Youth Housing dorm on Vindegade in Odense.

They all knew Betina Jørgensen Kjær as a very likable, diligent and very talented girl.  They had studied in the same group (M 17) with her since fall and have just now started the 2nd semester of their medical studies - an education that Betina would never be able to complete because of the bestial crime against her.

Yesterday, there were classes in chemistry for the M 17 group and the associate professor Gudrun Ploug-Sørensen asked for a minute's silence in the auditorium in memory of their murdered schoolmate.

"We knew Betina as a very diligent and talented student.  She was also modest and, if anyone needed a helping hand from her, they were not brushed off," say her classmates.
