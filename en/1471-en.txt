Even a stormy love affair cannot sweep political disagreements out of the way.

Therefore, the newly engaged Social Liberal Lone Dybkjær and Social Democrat Poul Nyrup Rasmussen must forget everything about politics, when they make love.

Jytte Hilden gives this advice to her close friend.  She is herself happily married for the fifth year to her fellow Social Democrat, Mogens Lykketoft.

"If you are practically ripping each others' hair out during the day, because you are in complete disagreement in some political debate, then it is clear that you have to have a Black Gold, before you can begin to make love.  You don't just run home and jump into the double bed.  That goes without saying.  And you just have to know that," says Jytte Hilden. 

The two politician couples have been close friends for many years.  Jytte Hilden and Lone Dybkjær are childhood friends, and Poul Nyrup Rasmussen and Mogens Lykketoft have been friends for more than 25 years.

They even have their degrees in common.  The girls are chemical engineers and the two boys are political scientists.
