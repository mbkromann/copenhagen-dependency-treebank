Anniversary stamp 

For 225 years, there has been a jewellery and watch industry in Pforzheim.  The anniversary was celebrated, among other ways, by the post office with the issuance of a 100 Pfennig stamp.  As long as supplies last, people interested can get an exemplar with the first day's postmark at Ständige Musterausstellung, Poststrasse 1, W-7530 Pforzheim.
