Nor in these cities has there been the monopoly that, for example, Nordisk Film has had in Copenhagen.  A monopoly that has almost cost them, the movie theatres and the art of film their lives.  In Copenhagen, there are actually only six premiere movie theatres left.  This is a very low number for a capital city of over 1 million inhabitants.

As in so many other areas, the Eighties' fixation on quick money and exaggerated expansion seems to be on the decline.  People are now slowly beginning to realise that there are other ways to skin a cat to entice people back to the theatres.  Here, Metronome, especially with the movie theatres Dagmar and Scala, seems to demonstrate a more fruitful way than the Palads group has gone.  Here, quality entertainment films are shown.

Finally, successes such as "Out of Africa", "Dances with Wolves" and the Danish "Memories of a Marriage" have demonstrated that there is an adult audience that is pining for the illustrated dreams of the movie theatres.  Why won't producers and movie theatres aim for an adult audience?  After all, we will be all adults one day.
