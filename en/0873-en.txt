Something else I wonder about as a young Dane is the fact that the government has approved the union treaty before it was even available in Danish.  If this is the way things are to be run, then I would rather belong to the stupid DÃ¤nen.

And then we can, at any rate, retain the system that sees to it that there are no beggars and homeless on the street to the extent that you see it in the big cities other places in the EC and Europe on the whole.

What do we need our sovereignty for, asks Weimann.  To the contrary, I would ask: What do we need economic growth for?  It does not lead to lower unemployment and a cleaner environment.  We have seen that in recent years.

It is also an incredibly egoistic idea to create a union where we in the rich countries can live securely with our material abundance, however much the poor countries shout.  We do not need to listen to them, because they can no longer threaten our welfare.  They will be kept outside the company, outside the "wall" that will be built up.
