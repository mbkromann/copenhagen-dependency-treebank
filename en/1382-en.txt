On the other hand, the SVX Coupe has traction on all four wheels, when it is to transmit 230 hp from the 3.3 liter 6-cylinder boxer motor with a top speed of 235 km/h.  The car has ABS brakes and airbag as standard and with respect to equipment is in the Japanese top class.

Because of the quota for exports of Japanese cars to Europe, Subaru can only export 35,000 cars to Europe and, of these, the Danish importer has been allotted 600 this year.

Subaru sells quite a few cars in Switzerland and Germany and can get more for the cars there, so there is no rush to flood the Danish stocks with Subaru cars.

The Danish importer, Vilh. Nellemann Autoimport, has decided to aim at the market for work cars instead of spreading himself too thin.

At the moment, therefore, the model program stocks temporary only Legacy.  Neither Justy nor Alto is in the program, and the light midsize car Leone is on the way out.  Instead, there will come a new midsize model in a year's time, Empressa, which presumably will also be incorporated into the Danish model program at that time.
