At 12:32 a.m. Danish time, the first bombs fell over Baghdad.

At 1:35 a.m., Israeli radio broadcast warnings to the population to seek shelter and to get out their gas masks.

At 1:38 a.m., Baghdad was a dead city.

"The city is totally dark.  The silence is almost noisy.  A cool breeze blows through the city," reported the CNN journalists from Baghdad.

"This has been a surprise attack.  It is incredible that there was no blackout in the city, when the attack came.

As far as we can see from the hotel, the destruction up until now has been limited and very targeted.  This could indicate that the attack is supposed to put a serious scare into Iraq.  If the US wanted, they could easily have bombed most of the city to pieces."

HELL IS LOOSE

1:44 a.m. Danish time, hell broke loose again over Baghdad.  An infernal racket of bombs, explosions and anti-aircraft fire.

"The refinery is hit again.  Flames are rising in the horizon.  This is the most violent attack to this point.  The bombs fell half a mile from the hotel," reported John Hollimann, Bernard Shaw and the veteran from Vietnam, war reporter Peter Arnett.
