The criminal police in Løgstør have not yet been able to ascertain whether the man has sought medical help, and assistance from the public is, therefore, requested to identify the perpetrator. 

He is described as between 25-30 years old, approx. 175 cm., ordinary build, short, black hair, dark eyes, a large hooknose and, perhaps, with a moustache.  He was dressed in what may have been a red T-shirt, a black leather vest and gray pants.  During their conversation at the restaurant Rio Bravo, he told the woman he was Iranian. 

NOT LIFE-THREATENING 

Medical officer Ib Steen Andersen, North Jutland County, cannot at this point say how dangerous the bite wound is; but, even though there are a lot of blood vessels in that part of the body, the medical officer does not consider the situation to be life-threatening.

"It is not an unknown phenomenon that men have been bitten in the body part mentioned.  We even have examples of a part that has been bitten off without it leading to death.

But unless the man seeks medical treatment, there is certainly a risk that he will get an infection in the wound, because there are actually more bacteria in a human bite than in, for example, a dog bite", says Ib Steen Andersen.
