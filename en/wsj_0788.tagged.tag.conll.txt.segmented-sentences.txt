The Senate Agriculture Committee is responding to trading abuses in the futures markets with a far-reaching bill that would become the Futures Trading Practices Act of 1989 .
The proposed legislation has a laudable goal : to assure the integrity of the U.S. futures markets .
However , as is common with sweeping legislation , the proposal contains many provisions that could destroy important parts of the system it sets out to preserve .
The complex bill , introduced by Sens. Patrick Leahy ( D. , Vt. ) , Richard Lugar ( R. , Ind. ) , and Bob Kerrey ( D. , Neb. ) , covers a wide range of provisions that would affect the funding and authority of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and would profoundly change the way the industry is regulated .
These include provisions relating to the technology and systems that must be employed by exchanges , oversight and disciplinary procedures for exchange trading practices , the relationship between commodity brokerage firms and floor traders , and exchange governance .
The bill also elevates even minor rule infractions to felonies and provides for recovery of punitive damages in civil lawsuits and arbitration cases without any showing of willful misconduct .
Many aspects of the bill are salutary , providing appropriate public safeguards that can and should be instituted throughout the industry .
Indeed , some of the bill 's requirements , including broad representation on the exchanges ' boards of directors and strong measures to prevent conflicts of interest , already have been put in place by the Coffee , Sugar & Cocoa Exchange and other futures exchanges .
Other aspects of the bill , however , are either structured in ways that create unnecessary burdens for the industry or actually are harmful to the exchanges , the industry and ultimately the general public .
One of the most prominent features is the requirement that in three years all exchanges have in place a system that records all trades by a source independent of the executing broker .
The New York futures exchanges have been working together to develop a trade recording system much like the one called for in the bill .
We would be delighted to have such a system in place today .
But is it realistic for Congress to mandate by a rigid deadline a system that has not yet been subjected to feasibility studies ?
What if the system does n't work ?
What if the only system that does work is so expensive that , at best , only the largest exchanges can afford it ?
Cost is a key consideration because of the global sweep of the financial markets .
The U.S. futures exchanges compete world-wide as never before .
Today , trading in almost any commodity can be diverted from U.S. markets with just a few strokes of a keyboard .
All foreign markets are aggressively courting U.S. business .
In fact , several London markets already offer lower costs for trading in the same or very similar contracts .
The U.S. exchanges need both market integrity and cost-efficiency ; long-term growth depends on it .
The Senate bill contains many provisions that will increase the costs of trading .
The most arbitrary of these is the imposition of `` service fees , '' which will directly widen the cost spread between U.S. and foreign markets .
Other provisions have a more subtle , but nonetheless real and detrimental effect on the international position of U.S. exchanges .
These include the extension of liability into areas beyond those established by judicial precedent and the expansion of liability to include punitive damages .
In addition to increasing costs as a result of greater financial exposure for members , these measures could have other , far-reaching repercussions .
One section of the bill would make all commodity brokerage firms and floor brokers liable for damages without willful misconduct .
Nowhere in the federal securities law is simple negligence or inadvertent action a source of liability under similar circumstances .
It is only logical to assume that the enactment of this provision will lead to increased litigation .
In an already low-profitmargin business , commodity brokerage firms may well decide to eliminate the risk and expense of dealing with the retail public , depriving the private individual of access to the markets .
Another measure makes commodity brokerage firms liable for violations committed by independent floor brokers who execute trades for them .
This untried concept would expose these firms to potentially astronomical punitive damages .
Faced with the virtually impossible task of supervising the execution of each trade , many commodity brokerage firms are likely to stop doing business with independents and instead hire their own salaried floor brokers .
This would force out of business many of the individuals and small firms that function as floor brokers .
A consequence of their departure could be a serious diminution of market liquidity .
Finally , under the bill , a number of legitimate , longstanding business practices would be arbitrarily banned , unless the CFTC were to take specific and timely action to permit them to continue .
In other words , regulation will occur through inaction and happenstance , rather than through a normal deliberative procedure .
The affected practices include the placing of oral orders , which is the way most public customer orders are placed , and trading between affiliated brokers , even though in some cases trading with affiliates may be the only way to obtain the best execution for a client .
Also precluded would be dual trading , whereby a broker trades for customers as well as his own account , a practice that provides needed liquidity to the markets .
All U.S. futures exchanges agree that these and other trading practices require proper regulation and supervision .
Nonetheless , each has too much potential value to the system to be banned by legislative fiat before the CFTC carefully considers all the consequences of a ban and what the regulatory alternatives are .
The markets are complex , as is the environment in which they function .
When problems surface , the temptation becomes strong to summarily overhaul a market system that has served for more than 100 years .
That temptation must be put aside to permit careful consideration of all the implications , positive and negative , of the proposed resolutions to those problems , and to avoid creating a marketplace where no one trades .
