DANISH rock musicians are no good at opting out, believes the author.

"NEITHER artists of word nor of paint would stand for a corresponding version of self-praise and back-slapping in the media," writes Anders Rou 

Jensen.

WITH address and zip code for rock musicians who make themselves available for interviews on television and in newspapers with "that special form of amnesia aimed at promoting their latest record, which is the best, most honest and unvarnished yet".

"You have to condemn the tepid marriage of convenience between the media and the business.  The way rock trumpets itself to death by gaining so much superficial attention that nobody is capable any longer of remembering what the goal and the purpose with the music was at the beginning," writes Jensen.

THERE is much more of the same ilk in the book.

WE quote from a final song:

"ROCK MUSIC in Denmark is defined by the name that, at any given point through eye-catching gimmick, private life or popularity, can sell the most newspapers or attract the most viewers to the screen.  Thus, C. V. Jørgensen is a lousy rock musician.  But Anne Linnet - ooh la la."
