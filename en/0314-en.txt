Nielsen cannot do anything but nod.  It is the one being interrogated who is running the interrogation, he thinks.


-  At the Phoenix, of course, they were incredibly grateful at the time for what my husband did.  We were even just about to get some Agfa colour film and, then, we'd have been the first to shoot a Danish feature film in colour!  It was supposed to have been "Live Life Easy".  But it was done in black-white and did not deserve better.  But it was shot!  There was work!


Mrs. Baumann shakes a new yawn away and leans forward in her chair.


-  And that was the general attitude in Denmark, but now people don't want to remember that any more and take revenge on those who did what they begged them to do!  The King said it.  Stauning said it.  The little man on the street said it, too: We were supposed to make it go smoothly 


Nielsen is thinking of his questions.  But he is unable to interrupt the sleepy, bitter woman.
