He looked at me with a strange glint in his green eyes.

-  As I said, it is not necessary for you to be here today.  I'm going out to Sonja again just after noon, and I will eat with her at the hospital.

-  Yes but ? then I was silent ? Allan and I want ? I was silent and turned my back to him, and then I almost fled back to the baby carriage.

-  Lotte, wait, he called behind me, and I stayed standing stiff as a pillar.

I heard the light rustling of his step in the grass, then he stood right behind me.

-  Come inside with me for a bit, he said softly.  -  It would be too bad to wake the boy, when he's just fallen asleep.

A warning bell went off in my brain, but I didn't listen to it.  I could not just go, it might be the last time I ever saw Jesper.


Lotte, I love you
