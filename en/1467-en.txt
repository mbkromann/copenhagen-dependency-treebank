Wanted: confidence.  Unibank's problem can be formulated that simply and, in an attempt to create confidence, Unibank's director, 52-year-old Steen Rasborg was fired yesterday with a parting gift of approximately DKK nine million.

Unibank needs customer confidence.

Unibank's chairman of the board Hugo Schr√∏der puts it in this way to B.T.:

"In each of the five latest public announcements, we have published numbers that have subsequently proved to be too optimistic.  This sort of thing, of course, does not promote confidence and credibility."

On the Copenhagen Stock Exchange as well, Unibank needs confidence.  Yesterday evening, shares were listed at their second-lowest level: at a price of 156.

Abroad, too, the reaction has been mistrustful.  Unibank has been put on the observation list of the Moody credit rating institute in New York.  Unibank already has the lowest rating in the best group, but now risks to be bumped down into the 2nd division with respect to the bank's securities with a term greater than a year.
