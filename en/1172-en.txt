The research councils have found a significant inertia in institutions.  But if they do not live up to the need for innovation and change, it will bolster the political incentive to do research programs instead of providing basic funding.

The competition for money has naturally had a certain influence on institutional planning.  This is not without its problems.  Research and development programs are often established on relatively short notice and their lifespan at the moment is limited to four-five years.

Experience up until now indicates that chances are good for follow-up programs, but there is no certainty.  The decision to stop or continue will to a great degree be dependent on the prominent attitudes in research policy in the future, which are so difficult to predict.

Uncertainty about the time horizon of the programs and inexpedient forms of financing make a consolidation of research difficult in the long term, the councils maintain in their report.  Help from outside.

One of the seven inter-council initiatives discussed is the relatively modest information program PIFT, which is not particularly well known outside research circles and affiliated businesses.  Now, emphasis is being laid on making results visible to the outside world.
