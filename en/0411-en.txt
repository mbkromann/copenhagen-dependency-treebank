It was to tease, Lene could see it in her eyes, and she had to punish her.  She took hold of the soft skin on her arm and squeezed, set her nails in, until the smile completely vanished, "is this also a dream?!"

Tanja squirmed and shook her head: "No, it hurts - sorry, Lene - aw, that hurts!"

Afterwards, she had to comfort her for a long time, and she was about to be late for school.  Simon was not standing at the footbridge, he had given up waiting.  Maybe, that is why he cannot get his things to sit right.  But she cannot both help him and think of what Tanja said, when she was naughty.
