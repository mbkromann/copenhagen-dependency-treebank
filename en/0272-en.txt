As thanks, young women can wangle a sweaty kiss on the cheek or a wet embrace and the children a pat on the hand, stretched out for the same purpose.

Even the 700 police officers at their posts participate keenly in the national festivals and send encouraging cries to the competing athletes, who despite pain and exhaustion and obstacles in the form of plastic cups maintain an incredible discipline with the greatest consideration for the other runners.

For every English mile and fifth kilometre, a clock has been setup, so the runners can gauge whether they are sticking to their personal times.  Along the entire route, there are refreshment stands, where eager volunteers stand ready with cups and beakers that the participants can grab in a hurry.

Every available fence is used as a pissoir by the male runners, while the poor women must let minutes go by in the line in front of the toilets.  First aid helpers take care of burst blisters, tend to burns, and calm down galloping muscles.
