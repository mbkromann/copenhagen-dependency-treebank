The boots are knocked clean.  Exhausted, I take off the many layers of ski clothes and know with certainty that the hotel's sauna and swimming pool are my next goal.

A blessed exhaustion overcomes me, when I sit down in front of the fireplace before dinner and stare into the fire.  I don't know whether I'm sleeping, thinking or just sitting.  At any rate, my legs almost cannot carry me into the large dining room.


STYLISH WITH LOTS OF FOOD

Here are small tables set with nameplates and small bottles of wine with the cork in from yesterday.  Everyone is dressed for dinner.  The children are sitting, water-combed and tired at the tables.  Only the orange-yellow Norwegian Fanta, Solus, can keep their eyes and mouths open.

Friendly, but quiet and no-nonsense service by girls with large flouncy aprons and strong, light brushed-back hair.  The legendary red cheeks which you can only take joy from seeing.  Three meals are served during the course of the day.  Breakfast is fantastic.  Porridge, muesli, prunes, raisins, cinnamon, cheese, eggs, sausage, marmalade, juice and bread of all types.  The foundation is laid.
