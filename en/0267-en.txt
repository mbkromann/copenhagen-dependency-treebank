Depeche themselves are having fun, while they are recording the record, where Martin, for example, goes to "Jungle Club" and watches a male stripper; but, apart from a sampled recording of Dave, who turns the ignition key in his newly purchased Porsche, there is not much to laugh at in "Black Celebration".  Are and do we people really live like this?  It almost brings you to tears (or to give your girlfriend an extra kiss, while there is still time, as in the title number).  Despite the gloomy tones and Depeche Mode's least hit-inspiring numbers to date, the record will be a success.  Particularly here at home, where Depeche will first give the Black Celebration show twice in Valby Hall for over 8,000 people (April), and later in the year return to conclude its world tour at the Sports Park, with over 14,000 fanatic devotees.  Lars Villemoes comments on the music in the following way in Information: "A tribute to joy and sexuality in a universe that gets limits and meaning from darkness and death, pain and necessity.  Yes!
