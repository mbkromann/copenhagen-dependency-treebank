Oluf Terp has taken his turn and can put a word in.  And not only that.  He does and writes in the newspaper about the patriotic necessity of defending the fatherland.  What once came to pass must never happen again.  Therefore, fortification and a people under arms.  But it doesn't end with that.


The enemy is not just the enemy.  If only it were so simple.  The enemy is among us.  Shady foreign elements of every type that have snuck into the country are the enemy.


Those who have helped them are the enemy, and those who defend those who have helped are the enemy.


Oluf Terp has an answer to these questions, many good men put to him these days.  An answer which he gives, when he is asked.


And he will gladly speak for a long time about his ideas.


-  The good men, he says, must gather around other good men.  Fewer in number but resolute to stand fast and contribute to the fatherland what it needs.
