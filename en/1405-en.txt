At one point, when the fervour in the Olé song was missing, because too little was happening, it had a contagious effect in the stands, he struck the ball.

Boom ? it went.

And the Germans had received the shock they never overcame.

The goal was the drug the exhausted men needed.

That is what was needed to "light" the dynamite and, with John Jensen as inspirator, the Danes began to challenge the Germans on their half of the field - a style of play they were not used to in the Bundes League, where they usually have time and space in their own zone.

But this form of pressure football requires strength.

And there was not much of that left in the Danish collective, which had to release their grip at times, so the Germans were able to put into motion their fatiguing if predictable tempo of play.

It was something to see:

If the Danes could clear the hurdle and put their confused opponents under pressure, the match could be won.
