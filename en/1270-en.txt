The operation itself takes place by looking into the Queen's knee via a so-called arthroscopy to get an overview of how large the lesion is.  Then, you adjust the meniscus by scraping off what was injured.  The cartilage may also be smoothed out.  Both operations can take place on an outpatient basis and do not necessarily require bed rest.

If anyone should think that it is because the Queen is overweight, I can dismiss this.

It is more likely that the Queen had soft cartilage in her youth.  And the various falls she has had, for example, in Rebild Hills, can lead to her having difficulty in controlling the soft kneecaps.

But once she has had the knee operated on, she will be free from the pain.

However, this requires that she specifically train the thigh muscles with stretching exercises over a cushion," says the orthopaedic surgeon.

EXPERT IN THE FIELD
