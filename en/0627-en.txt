With its derivative prefix, the concept of in-sane arouses inevitable conceptions of desertion of sanity and spiritual impoverishment.  And the fact of the matter is just the opposite.  Because if you want knowledge of the human mind's multiplicity of expression of, its possibilities of external appearance and facets of articulation and you want insight into the wealth of the human world of experience, mood swings and the intimacy of emotions, the limitlessness of the life of the imagination and the multiplicity of sense illusions - since it is in those who bear the mark of insanity you should seek to find what you are looking for; far away from the sphere of the sober-minded.

In this way, the concept of insanity provides at once a space for the bitterest human suffering and deep depression and the highest degree of a feeling of omnipotence and desire; - and thus anything other than spiritual impoverishment.

But for someone who has witnessed two world wars and who now surveys a world in fear of a third and final one.  And for someone who in a na√Øve youthful conviction of the fundamental goodness of the human spirit, grounded in a hope of a just society of human rights, and who now sees it "realized" in ever more compromising shapes.
