However, it cannot be precluded that the process of shifting from effervescent European euphoria to flat Danish phlegm will cause the players significantly greater problems than the 3s might immediately imagine.

In this connection, it is worth remembering that the concentration, courage and mental strength of the celebrated Copenhagen UEFA Cup heroes in their basic game in the fall's Super League did not at all live up to the performances of the same players at the international level.

If you go behind the scenes in B1903, the cracks in the polished, external façade may seem even more conspicuous.

The plans around the placement of the training camp in Paris, the choice of the mediocre sparring partners up to the first match against AC Torino, and the farcical exploitation - or lack of same - of the hired gun Ole Kjær, have undeniably had more of a stamp of amateurism and discount solutions than of focussed athletic professionalism.

This has been and continues to be B.T.'s clear opinion, which the many soothing, academic explanations issued from the official Fuehrer bunker on Lyngbyvejen do not change.
