A dream has become reality.

You have become a member of an exclusive football family.

That it was a poor family did not mean so much at that time.

The fortunes that came in on national matches went for the development of new talents.

There was no money for player wages or premiums.

A silver spoon, knife or fork every so often - maybe, an ashtray with the city arms in the middle - was the players' reward for entertaining.

And then there was the promise that they could come free to the national football matches for the rest of their lives.

But that was only a half truth.

It turns out today.

The claim that a football player does not execute the last kick - he receives it, has been confirmed on beautiful DBU paper with a logo.

It can no longer afford to preserve a beautiful tradition.

"Lean new times," promised the football managers, when the agreements to build large and in luxury class fell into place.

But in their enthusiasm for the possibilities of the future, they forgot all too many of those who helped create those of the past.
