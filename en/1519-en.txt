"The personnel had to wake him in the crew quarters and the train, which later met with an accident in Næstved, pulled out of Nykøbing F. with a few minutes delay."

The head of traffic also acknowledges that the report of the accident investigation group shows that the engine driver on the toxic waste train was moonlighting big time.

"The moonlighting came out in connection with the work of the accident investigation group, but I want to emphasise that the accident investigation group does not believe that the engine driver's moonlighting had any affect whatsoever on the train collision in Næstved," says Henrik Nørgaard.

THE GUILTY

DSB's own investigations, the result of which police commissioner J. P. Clausen, Næstved, received yesterday, designates the engine driver as the guilty party in the train collision at Næstved Station early on the morning of September 25.

A collision, which was close to having catastrophic consequences, because a tanker with the toxic substance acrylonitrile sprang a leak.

All train service to and from Næstved had to be discontinued in the early morning hours, and a total of 26 persons went to the hospital.  Including seven policemen, who were near the leaking tanker, until fire commissioner Svend Åge Jensen, realised that it was hazardous material seeping out and polluting the railway terrain.
