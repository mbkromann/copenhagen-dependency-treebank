And I am afraid that the Italians from Torino are the smartest in the tactical game before Wednesday's quarter final in the UEFA tournament at Gentofte's tightly-packed but not particularly user-friendly Stadium.

If you are to believe the Italians - but you shouldn't - then, yes, they have us almost convinced that they will be happy to escape their visit to Denmark with a modest defeat.

POPPYCOCK

Of course, this is poppycock.

Not one of the Torino travelling companions believes that they can lose in Copenhagen.

Of course, there is a risk that the celebrated football millionaires, who no longer hide that none of the Danish names mean anything to them, might just underestimate their opponents, so their commitment becomes limp and the price for the mistake greater than they care for.

But the problem is theoretical.

The Italians know what the challenge at Gentofte Stadium entails and they should -judged soberly - not meet with greater difficulties than they can handle by virtue of their quality and training condition.
