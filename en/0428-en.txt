Some of the planes went so low that they made the iron chains in the booms to vibrate, large shadows thundered over our heads, one had to hope that they found the way up to their formation again.  One man came biking up and jumped off, it was Silius, the civil defence and the CBs were under him and he was out to see whether any of them had deserted.  -  You've got your work cut out for you, said the bicycle dealer,  -  If it isn't English agents, then it's them up there.  You must be getting tired soon.

-  It's all part of the service, answered Silius.  - By the way, you shouldn't be on the tracks, it's forbidden.

-  There won't be any more trains this evening, said Schrøder readily.
-  What happened with that guy who came down from the skies, did you catch him?

-  Of course not, a guy like that knows what he is supposed to do, replied the village constable.  -  He probably took off on a bicycle ten minutes after he had landed. He is not here in town, at any rate.
