JESS INGERSLEV can do the same - the being caught off-guard, crazy - and shows it several times.  He acts with a lot of self irony on the mercurial - of which the review could have used a bit more.  The craftsman-like performance is in top form.  It has lots of hip, but it seems to lack the last whistle - also even though it has the splendid Tom McEwan, who can whistle - between his teeth - and much more: Among other things, sing rock as a parody of a puffed-up concert vocalist.

WITH such a splendid team as this: Therese Damsholt, Margrethe Koytu, Jess Ingerslev, Tom McEwan and Finn Nielsen - it is a shame that there are so few numbers in which they are all together, that really exploit the range of their collective talents.  Fortunately, this happens quite wonderfully at the end.  In a wild and crazy and completely original operetta parody.  The Price brothers have composed romantic music and perverted us to it with an absurd text about a flasher, a pervert, a transvestite and two small horny girls in the park.
