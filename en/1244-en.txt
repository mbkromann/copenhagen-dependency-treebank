If a prime minister is manic depressive (Viggo Kampmann was), it has historical relevance, because one assumes that a man who suffers from a serious mental illness is not competent in every situation.

In the HÃ¦kkerup case, you have the question: Why in the world were the lines drawn like that?  If they were, because the minister was not sober, then you cannot pass it by.  The borderline is there, where you demand an explanation that otherwise cannot be given.
