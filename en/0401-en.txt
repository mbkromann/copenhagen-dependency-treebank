What do you need for a trip to be pleasant even in weather other than sunshine?  The most important thing may be having something sensible on your feet.  We must be good to our feet - they are to carry us many km for many years and, regardless of how used you are to it, it is hard on the feet to transport us for kilometres on uneven forest paths and hard asphalt roads.

Therefore, you should have a couple of strong walking shoes or boots.  Whether you choose shoes or boots is a matter of taste.  Your feet may not be so warm in shoes, but, on the other hand, boots provide some support for the ankles.  Which you might want to keep in mind, if you have a tendency to twist your ankle.

At any rate, it is an advantage, if footwear is equipped with durable soles.  Thin rubber shoes are not well suited for the purpose.

Even dress is hardly so important, as long as the clothes are roomy and not tight, lest you risk chafing in exposed places and that is not so pleasant.
