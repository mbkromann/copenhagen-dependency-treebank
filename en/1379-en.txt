So, when she was in Berlin in 1960, before the official tribute, she was also met by people who hooted and whistled at her and called her a traitor.

The minister Gottfried Wiarda touched on the subject, when during his eulogy he said that Marlene Dietrich had also had great sorrows in her life.

"Above all, the sorrow it is not always to being understood in her native land," said the minister, addressing the fact that Marlene Dietrich was wrongly viewed by many Germans as a traitor.

The clergyman, however, was not the only one who eulogized the legendary film actress.  The actor and director Maximillian Schell, who acted together with her in the film "Judgment at Nuremberg" said, when the coffin was slowly lowered into the ground, "Dear Marlene - welcome home.  I think you would have loved the many ovations", addressing over a thousand people who had applauded in time outside the cemetery, when the Cadillac with her coffin on board marched past.
