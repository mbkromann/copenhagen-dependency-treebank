"The situation is that my current contract expires with the new year.

If I say yes to an extension, I expect that Brøndby's management will "gild" the offer for me in a way that will, at least partially, be able to compete with the money I would otherwise have scraped together abroad."

In line with most of the changing room's other jubilant Brøndby'ers, Bjarne Jensen was willing to admit that the Super League finale had never really been able to ignite from a purely entertainment point of view.

"We're going to end the ball for Lyngby in the first half.

But even if we had in the back of our minds from the start that we should be able to bring the game home, we never got proper control of the midfield.

Emeka Ezeugo making a fool of himself, on his own and his colleagues' behalf, is unfortunate but also pretty stupid.

I'm sure that the same stupidity in us would have cost the offender a hefty fine!"
