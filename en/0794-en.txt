The whole question of an EC defence policy is to be taken up again in 1996 "on the basis of a report which the Council is to present to the European Council (i.e., the EC summit meeting) in 1996 and which is to include an evaluation of the progress and experiences that have been garnered to that point."

The nine EC countries that are members of the WEU have in a declaration on the Maastricht treaty gone into more detail as to what is imagined with this revision in 1996:

"The WEU member states are agreed about strengthening the role of the WEU, as the perspective over the long run is a common defence policy within the European Union, which in time will be able to lead to a common defence that is compatible with the Atlantic Alliance defence" (NATO).

At the same time, it is said that "the WEU is to be developed as the defence component in the European Union and as a means for strengthening the European pillar in the Atlantic Alliance.  With this end in mind, the WEU will work out a common European defence policy and promote its concrete implementation by virtue of a further development of its operational role".
