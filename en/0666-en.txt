The time when, by his own account, he drank more than five bottles of whiskey a day.  The periods when, at regular intervals, he was arrested by the police.  40 times alone, because he was driving without a licence, even though, because of drunk driving, he had lost the right to drive a car until 1999.  But even then, he was sentenced to six months in prison for threatening two officers with a rifle barrel on a residential street in Næstved.

A sentence, however, which he never served.  Before then, the Ministry of Justice had been able to declare him unfit for punishment on account of a persecution complex.

In recent years, he has lived a withdrawn life in a four and a half room apartment in Frederikberg.  Fodbygård Manor near Næstved was taken from him and sold by the trustees of the estate.

Today, Bøje Nielsen is married for the second time to Hanne Taarup Nielsen.  He is not employed, but receives each month an amount of DKK 20,000 from his adversary Axel Juhl-Jørgensen.
