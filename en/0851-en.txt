At an age of only 27, the young J.D. Helle Stangerup debuted in 1967 with a splash of a detective novel, "Epitaph for Red Riding Hood".  The year after, she repeated her success with "Yellow Gloves", and in 1969 she published a real horror thriller, "Mirror Dance".  This novel has become the first Helle Stangerup publication at the author's new publishing house Lindhardt & Ringhof, and the publishers are trying to attract readers by publishing the book in hard binding - a so-called hardback.  Despite the 23 years behind it, "Mirror Dance" is still a fascinating and, in many ways, disturbing reading experience.  We are in the West Berlin of the Cold War, where a young Danish girl is spending a vacation in a small apartment.  One day, there is a bouquet with 11 long stem roses outside the door with the following cryptic and macabre message: Mylady.  We are children, we are dead, we are eleven dead children, but we never forget.  And some day we shall have our revenge.  Suddenly, she finds herself in a struggle against unknown forces.  Without a clue why she is in danger.
