They do not know what makes the South and North Pole switch places.  It may be due to changes in electrical currents in the Earth's fluid outer core.


The Earth's magnetic field has many times in the history of the Earth been "reversed".  They know that there is between a half a million and two million years between reversals.


In consideration of the Earth's age, the reversals themselves happen quickly: only around 10,000 years!


How do homing pigeons find their way home?


Homing pigeons can find their way home over long distances - even from places they have never been before.


The birds have an impressive ability to find their way home, even over stretches they have never seen before.


One of the cleverest birds is the homing pigeon.  It uses several things to orient itself.  Among other things, it can use its sense of smell.  The pigeons know how home smells and, if the wind bears traces of that smell to the pigeon, it can use it to choose a flight direction.  homing pigeons also use their sense of hearing.  The sound of, for example, the slapping of waves they can capture at a long distance and thus know where the coastline is.
