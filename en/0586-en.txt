We also want to establish Nordic contacts, so that we can bring Norwegian and Swedish into Danish education in a more interesting and natural way than we can do just by reading texts.


Electronic network - and network of schools 

The school's work with electronic mail is made possible by a subscription to an electronic network with transit nodes all over the world, EARN (European Academic Research Network).  We have been fortunate in getting help and guidance from one of the school's parents, Kirsten Anttila, who is connected to a research project on informatics in the school's subject at the Danish University of Education.  Here, she is the Danish co-ordinator of a contact network of schools all over the world.  We ourselves are now part of the network as a contact school as well.


Opportunities in many subjects 

We have, for natural reasons, begun the development of the electronic letter writing in languages, but there are opportunities for bringing in international contacts in many subjects.  For example, it makes good sense to use one's English or one's German in connection with the Baltic project.
