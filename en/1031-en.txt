Growth in world trade fell in 1991.  Calculated in quantity and in price.  This was the third year in a row.  A good guess on the trend this year would be a renewed fall.  The decline in growth follows a corresponding number of years with increasing growth.  Therefore, the negative trend is noted with great attention.  All talk turns on the extent to which one can create increased trade through a breakdown of the last tariff walls, a dilution of agricultural subsidies, an establishment of free trade zones, and a removal of trade barriers generally.  Nor, fortunately, can GATT's numbers for the trend in the scope of world trade be interpreted as the negative signal that immediately can be read in the numbers.

The explanation lies primarily in the continued decline in production.  When the rise in production decreases, the need for international exchange of goods also falls.  It is thus through economic growth that both the conditions and the need for trade are created between countries.  The numbers from the annual report of the coordinators of the international tariff and trade agreement, GATT, illustrate with all desirable clarity the results of the path towards zero growth, which the world as a whole has entered since 1988 and where 1991 is the reference point until there are numbers for 1992.
