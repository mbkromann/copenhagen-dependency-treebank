With that, the existence of the neutron was demonstrated!


Nuclear physics after the discovery of the neutron

After Chadwick had demonstrated the neutron, people no longer doubted that the atomic nucleus was actually constructed of protons and neutrons.

People began now to interest themselves in how these protons and neutrons were held together in the core, and how they move around between each other.

We still do not clearly know the answer to a long series of these questions.  But we have constructed various models of the nucleus that each in themselves provide for a satisfactory account of a number of the observations people have made, but not for all of them.

People have sacrificed great sums of money to build apparatuses in which they can accelerate charged particles at enormous speeds, so they can be used as projectiles to shoot at various atomic nuclei.

In this way, people have discovered a long series of new particles, which most often only exist for incredibly short periods.  These particles play a decisive role in understanding what sort of forces there are that hold the neutrons and the protons together in the nucleus.
