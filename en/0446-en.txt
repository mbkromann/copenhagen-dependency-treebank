The box is a result of one of rock history's most ambitious record projects: It contains the complete series of original recordings from Elvis' production in the '50s.

Several years of careful work in seeking out and gently restoring known and unknown master tapes are behind it.

It has ended up here in five CDs with no less than 140 numbers packaged with a 48-page booklet with over 100 rare Elvis photographs, an Elvis discography, a complete catalogue of all the studio recordings in which he participated in the '50s, notes and biographies - a breathtakingly beautiful boxed set!

And, moreover, this is the best-sounding and credible digitalisation of old recordings we have heard.  A true A-plus for this valuable work for posterity.

The set contains, among many other goodies, the first, sensational recording on vinyl that Elvis recorded in the Sun Records studio.

The recording first turned up in 1988 at one of Elvis' classmates.

Among the rarities are also 14 complete recordings, which have just materialized from the dust and here for the first time ever are released on record - to the enthusiasm and pleasure of the world's Elvis fans.
