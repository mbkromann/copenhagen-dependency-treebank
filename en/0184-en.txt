Pasta is sold freshly made, dried, and in prepared dishes, and is used together with fish, fowl, meat and vegetables.

Since we began to produce fresh pasta, we have doubled sales every year.  This year, we count on selling 700 tons - this corresponds to 2.8 million packages, says product manager Lars Bred, Tholstrup Cheese.

Tholstrup Cheese is the only Danish producer of fresh pasta, but there are rumors in the dairy industry that a major bread producer will also start up production before long.

We can sense the trends abroad that there is a future in pasta, says Lars Bred, who yesterday returned home from the world's largest food fair NUGA in Germany.

Export

Pasta is still only a small part of Tholstrup Cheese's business.  Only 30 of the firm's 500 employees deal with the supple strips.

Yet, the firm already has exports to Norway, Sweden and Finland, and Lars Bred even believes that Italy itself will be a good customer country for his goods.
