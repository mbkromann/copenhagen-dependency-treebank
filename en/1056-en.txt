Lars Højer is not old enough yet to make into a museum, so all that stuff about "down in the yard" belonging to a distant past doesn't hold, when you were born and grew up in Nørrebro and here in 1992 and have not even reached the age of 22.

And it is completely without sentimentality (he is not old enough to be sentimental) that Lars Højer talks about his football childhood.  It really is just an ordinary everyday story.  A story from which you can derive the lesson that fathers who are in such a hurry to sign their seven-year-old sons up in a major club should, perhaps, stop to think that our greatest names in football almost all started in a minor club.

Lars Højer is one of the many.  He wore out his first pair of football shoes in the Heimdal community club.  Lars' father believed the club was just the thing.

At the same time he was playing with Heimdal, Lars was training as though his life depended on it at home in the yard, where he fired with his right foot for hours, so that his kick eventually became one of the hardest and most precise in the Super League.
