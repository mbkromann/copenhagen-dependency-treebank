PARADISE

In his first season for Valenciennes, Papin scored 15 goals.

He was good, but not good enough for a major French club to want to buy the strange "bumpkin".

Instead, Club Brugge struck.  An interim sum of 1.3 million francs saved Valenciennes from bankruptcy.

Papin received a hike in wages, and success was waiting just around the corner.

In Brugge, the little goal-dangerous Frenchman scored in the season 1985-1986 a total of 21 league goals, six hits in the cup tournament and five bull's-eyes in the UEFA Cup.

Papin's fortune was made for sure.

France's national coach at that time Henri Michel could no longer get around him.  At the World Championships in Mexico, he scored two goals, one in the bronze match against Belgium.

Marseille's filthy-rich owner, finance prince Bernard Tapie, struck and brought him to the big Mediterranean city for DKK nine million.

"Marseille was just pure paradise for me.

In Brugge, I earned 8,000 francs a month, in Marseille suddenly it was twentyfold that.
