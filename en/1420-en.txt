The new businesses will particularly be located in the areas south of Bella Centre, which is now open to very intense construction.  On the other hand, consideration must be given to a higher degree to the nature north of Bella Centre, where 31 hectares in all will be exempt on environmental grounds.

That part of the Amager Commons, which has not become a part of Ørestaden is to be preserved.  It concerns 240 hectares and the area is to have the character of a large urban park.  Together with Kalvebodkilerne, which is preserved today, Amager will have a natural park of 25 square kilometres in all.

Culture is also to be considered in Ørestaden.  Ny Tøjhusgrunden is to be developed as soon as possible, preferably with a culture and music centre.  In addition, the area around the lakes in the northern part of Ørestaden is to be an exhibition area.  The parties suggest a Baltic exhibition in connection with Copenhagen's status as a city of culture in 1996.

And, then, Amager will finally get its S-trains.  Two lines are to be laid.  One, the east Amager line, will go beneath Amager and out to Kastrup.  The other line, the Ørestad line, will go along Islands Brygge and west of the university to Tårnby.
