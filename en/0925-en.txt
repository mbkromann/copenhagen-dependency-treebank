On June 15, DR-TV broadcast a program in the series "Public Opinion, this time on the question "Should parents have permission to hit their children?": On the occasion of the 25th year after the abolition of corporal punishment in schools, the question is raised whether it should continue to be exempt from punishment for parents to hit their own children?"

The framework itself for these programs - with lawyers and witnesses for and against in a tight timeframe - is quite unsuitable for the treatment of a question of this breadth and depth.  And one is tempted to ask: what is it at all good for?  That it is very good at simplifications came out clearly, at any rate.  The simplification occurs in two stages:

1 ) First, you take the entire family dynamic between parents and children and pull something out of it that people call "upbringing" - a quite randomly demarcated phenomenon.  Only the people who write books on the subject know where the boundaries are to be drawn and they are definitely not in agreement.  Even a professor in education could speak of "upbringing", so that it sounded as if it was an objective scientific phenomenon with a concrete existence.
