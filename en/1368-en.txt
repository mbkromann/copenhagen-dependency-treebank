"I do not think the formation of a Nordic block is a good idea.  Nor do I think that it could be done, because in quite a few areas, especially the economic, we do not particularly agree," says Uffe Ellemann-Jensen.

But if support for Lars P. Gammelgaard's Nordic ideas is modest from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, it is not for the Social Democrats.

"I do not think there will be any great risk that the co-operation will end in the formation of a block.  There will be areas where the Nordic countries can co-operate and areas where we cannot.  So, a collective block will never come into existence.  But I think that the heart of most Danes beats for a Nordic collaboration, while their brain supports an EC collaboration.  In the EC, we have the opportunity to unite heart and brain," says the Social Democratic chairman for the Common Market Committee, Ivar NÃ¸rgaard.

The Prime Ministers of the Nordic countries will at an extraordinarily convened session of the Nordic Council in November establish a line for Nordic collaboration with the EC.
