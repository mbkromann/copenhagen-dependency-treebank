Mai Buch and Boel JÃ¸rgensen knew each other from previous work on the organisational development of Roskilde University Centre.  When Mai Buch began her position as deputy director of the Danish Royal Theatre with responsibility for finances, one of her watchwords was that improved efficiency was to be achieved through better working conditions for employees.

This attitude has, without doubt, been part of creating the good reputation that she has in the theatre, where, despite her position as the person pulling the purse strings, she is deeply respected.

Nowhere in Mai Buch's examination transcripts is there any indication that she would wind up in a theatre.

The former permanent undersecretary for the Ministry of the Environment is actually educated as an M. Eng. and left a position as a consultant for the firm Merciri Urval for the Danish Royal Theatre.

At the same time she was studying to be a civil engineer, she was able to study both sociology and philosophy and write a master's thesis on alternative city plans.  Organisation and personnel relations quickly emerged as her preferred field, and this interest made her drop central administration for private business.
