"Spare us any more useless talk," asked Enzo Biagi, one of Italy's most respected journalists, in a commentary in the newspaper Corriere Della Sera on Monday.  He was in line with many who are now demanding that the state declare war on the Mafia and stop simply defending itself against attacks.  And by war, they do not mean stationing 2,000 draftees in and around Palermo.  With the unique efficiency that Italy is also able to achieve, they were already in place on Tuesday morning.  But Palermo's inhabitants are not impressed.  They view it as a mockery that young boys equipped with machine guns should be the best means against the mafia.  The super-law.

A state funeral must not to be the only thing you can offer the opponents of the Mafia, it is put ironically about the participation of politicians and police commissioners in Tuesday's funeral.  Italy's newly elected president normally enjoys great respect, but Oscar Luigi Scalfaro appeared Tuesday surrounded by the angry and powerless colleagues of the murdered bodyguards.  Just like Italy's police commissioner Vincenzo Parisi, the head of state had to endure angry shouts and duck people who were striking and kicking at him.
