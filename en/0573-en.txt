The large Viking graveyard at Over Hornbæk, a little west of Randers, has previously been mentioned in Skalk (1986:5), so we shall leave off further introduction and turn our attention straight away to a specific grave from a part of the area that seems reserved for the more well to do.  The grave pit itself was rather large in extent but with little depth, only approximately 40 cm down into the subsoil.  There are traces of a wooden coffin, but nothing of the dead person himself; all the bones disintegrated long ago.  The paraphernalia consisted of an iron knife in a leather sheath with silver thread wrapped around the wooden shaft (this already indicates that the grave owner was a bit above the ordinary), a whetstone, various other small items and - as indicated in the introduction - a large indeterminate clump of rust.  The latter became in the hands of the conservators a ceremonial axe, a rarity of form as well as decoration.  In the eye of the axe, there was a piece of wood left, a part of the shaft.  How long it originally was is impossible to say, since we do not know how the dead person was positioned in the grave.
