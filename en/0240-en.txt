-  They begin to sleep with their backs to each other and cannot talk about it.  They stop kissing and caressing in order not to set in motion expectations that cannot be redeemed by the other. It becomes a relief for them to drop their sexual life altogether.


NOT A WORD ABOUT AIDS

The book travels far afield - from sexual fantasies to childlessness to male diseases.  The psychological aspect is touched on in every chapter.

One topic, however, the authors have decided to preclude - AIDS: - we're tired of death anxiety and sexuality having to be so closely bound up together.  It is a disease that must be taken seriously, but, as we have written in the foreword, you can look for expert knowledge on AIDS elsewhere, where lots of material may be found on the disease.

Thomas Gerstenberg and Beth Lilja Pedersen have agreed on most of the contents of the book.  An agreement that is not always present between the physically-oriented medical specialists and sexologists.
