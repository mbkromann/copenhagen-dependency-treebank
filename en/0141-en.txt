After the national "A" team's practice in Nyborg yesterday, national coach Richard 
Møller Nielsen had only decided on five of the players for the starting lineup against Bulgaria tonight at Odense Stadium.

In the absence of the Brøndby players, Jakob Friis-Hansen, who ordinarily plays in Lille, will get Lars Olsen's chance as sweeper.  Jakob Friis-Hansen has played that position in France in three of the five games in which he has played, since he recovered from a groin injury. 

"It is the position I am hungry to play on the national team -  and the only one I really feel I can play.  Of course, it is Lars Olsen's position, but it is good to have something to fight for.  And if I can make a good effort,  Richard Møller Nielsen will, of course, notice it."

Lars Olsen's cancellation also gives veteran John Sivebæk a new function, the captain's post. OB's Johnny Hansen will start as defender, while Lars Elstrup, Luton, and debut player Bjarne Goldbæk, Kaiserslautern, will begin the game at midfield.  Otherwise, the only sure thing is that Jan Heintze will play a half-game at most -  a demand from his club, PSV 
Eindhoven.
