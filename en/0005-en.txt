The debate about foreigners in Denmark must not lead to xenophobia and racism.

Therefore, the leaders of the political parties must assume a direct responsibility.

So believes the vice chairperson of the Social Democratic Party, Birte Weiss, who suggests that political leaders support the equal opportunity board that Parliament shortly before the summer vacation decided to appoint.

Birte Weiss makes reference to Germany, where the dialogue has been short-circuited with fire bombs and dramatic clashes.  "We will not tolerate the same thing happening in Denmark," she says.

Information Secretary for Denmark's Social Democratic Youth (DSU) Hans Stavnsager is pleasantly surprised by the idea.

DSU has long believed that the Social Democratic Party took much too little a part in the debate on foreigners.  Therefore, DSU is currently and in the months ahead mounting a campaign against xenophobia and racism, in which young people through posters, among other things,  encourage people to take a position: "Who do you support" is the text above pictures of Mogens Glistrup and a small Yugoslavian girl.

"This is the first time I have heard such a clear message from the Social Democratic Party" says Hans Stavnsager.
