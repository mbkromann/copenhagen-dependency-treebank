It's all a little unclear to me, and I would be grateful for an answer.
L. P. Answer:

It is understandable that a sales representative would like to take special "handpicked" effects with them, but if the relevant effects were secured to a wall upon the viewing of the house, they must not be removed without special agreement with the purchaser.  These things have been a part of setting the price and selling the house.  The situation corresponds a bit to the situation in which you would not be allowed to remove extra car lights, etc., either, after having sold your car.  Fixed equipment goes along.

In the standard terms and conditions of a real estate broker's binder, there is also as a rule written, in addition to the fact that the house is sold as is with wall- and nailed fixtures, a more detailed explanation of what is included as a fixture:

"To the extent they are installed, wall outlets, plumbing, fixed bathroom equipment, including lamps, mirror, shelves, outdoor lamps, refuse stands, FM/TV antenna, postbox, electric radiators, electric and gas water heaters and fixed carpets."

In the present case, you must also not remove those things mentioned.
