With the help of a bonus equalisation fund, life insurance companies have been able to maintain a relatively high interest on pension savings deposits in the end of the 1980s/beginning of the 1990s, when competition from financial institutes was increased.  The principle of storing large capital gains for "lean years" is in beautiful accord with "the average cost formula", but is it also in accord with the interests of retirement investors?

The answer to this is no.  The reality behind the life insurance companies' use of the average cost formula is that savings are made during the "fat years" for use in the "lean years", but not the reverse!  I.e., in the 1980s, savings were purposely transferred from earlier investments to new retirement investors.  Therefore, the old retirement investors have paid for the companies' struggle for customers in the 1980s.

A transfer fee of 7 percent on retirement investors' accounts, where by transferring their retirement savings  the investors have not received their share of the accumulated bonus equalisation fund, can therefore only be seen as competition-inhibiting.  Therefore, it is unfortunate that HRH is adducing arguments for keeping the 7 percent fee, which has no foundation in the actual behaviour of the life insurance companies.
