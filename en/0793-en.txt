Hekmatyar's forces stormed a police station near the presidential palace and shelled the southeastern part of the city with rockets.

At the same time, a caravan with 51 members of Afghanistan's new government was on its way from northeastern Afghanistan on a course towards Kabul.

The caravan, consisting of several dozen trucks and cars, which was guarded by heavily armed rebels, is on an uncertain course on the 250 km long, twisting road from the border town of Peshawar in Pakistan to Kabul, because the various sections of the caravan are controlled by rival mujahedin groups.
