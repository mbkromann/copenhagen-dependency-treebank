It is a precondition that there is created or there is a firm foundation - before a lasting "jack effect" can work, it is therefore an unconditional requirement that the deeper layers of soil are viable, put in another way, you cannot think that you can just put a Band-Aid on an uncleansed wound - and then think that it will heal of itself.

Danger of restoration 

The firm makes a proviso in its offer against damage from water-, gas line- and electrical installations, except that the costs of repairing damage to pipes shall be defrayed, if they are within eight centimetres of their placement on the blueprints provided - in my experience of the business, it is very rare that these pipes are placed so precisely in relation to the blueprints.  I consider it, therefore, too risky to force a floor back to its original level, when the respective pipes must follow along.  God knows whether natural gas companies will be able to accept the solution - particularly, when you take the latest explosion damage into consideration?
