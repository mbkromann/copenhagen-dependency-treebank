Christmas in Norway 

Faithful to traditional, the Norwegian Travel Agency has Christmas and New Year's trips to Norway.  To Gausdal Høifjellshotell and to Kampsæter and Ruten Fjellstue.  The trips are with DFDS to Oslo and by bus from there to Guldbrandsdalen.

The trip plus five days with complete room and board during Christmas week at Gausdal costs DKK 4,415 for an adult in a double room with bath and toilet.  Children under 16 per adult in double room costs DKK 450.  It may be cheaper, for example, if you stay in a three- or four-bunk cabin on the boat, and more expensive if, for example, you want to stay in the luxury wing of the hotel.  To the Alps in your own car.

If you prefer to drive yourself on a ski vacation, Dansk Fri Ferie, Valby, brokers a number of apartments in the well-known but also the less well-known ski resorts in Austria, France, Switzerland and Italy.
