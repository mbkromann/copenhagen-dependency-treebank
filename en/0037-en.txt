600 NOT ALLOWED

600 Brugsens have not been allowed to become Super-Brugsens.  Most of them must close, believe the experts.  In addition, FDB predicts that 200 jobs will be cut out of savings considerations in the new Super-Brugsens.

Previously, the large Brugsens had 20,000 different goods on the shelves.  In order to save, the number will be cut down to 8,000.  This will finance part of the price reductions.  The rest will come from an expected sales hike.
