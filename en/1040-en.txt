Tabori is a Jew from Hungary, but has lived and worked as a journalist and dramatist in Hollywood and in England, where he moved as early as 1936.  His whole family, with the exception of his mother, was wiped out at Auschwitz.  

He has said that the truth is never pretty, but that it is often funny.  He seems to have ascribed this view to the Bible and to the description of himself, which he provides in the two central characters in the play, Mr. Jay and Goldberg.

Søren Sætter-Lassen plays the tormented Goldberg and in the roles as the actors in Mr Jay's theatre may be seen Tammi Øst, Kirsten Olesen, Ole West Madsen, Jannie Faurschou, Peter Gilsfort and Ulver Skuli Abildgaard.  Hells Angels are played by Christian Mosbæk, Kim Jansson, Per Linderoth, Annemette Bush and the newly-qualified, debuting Rikke Weissfeld.

Finn Erik Bendixen, who is also new to the Royal Theatre, has created the scenography for the demented theatre on theatre, which will be opening to the public with its premiere on September 1.
