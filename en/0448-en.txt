I am writing to find out whether I can continue taking Chlorella in the future.  I have already taken it for three weeks.

I would like to tell a little bit about what it has helped me with.  It is no small thing:

For 13 years, I have had great pain in my hips and down in both my legs - especially in the knees.  I almost could not walk or ride a bicycle.  My buttocks were always cold, so that I had to wear camelhair all year round.  After 14 days with Chlorella, I noticed an inner warmth - especially in the hips - and the pain became less severe.  Now after three weeks, I can go for walks, bicycle and everything without difficulty.

And Chlorella has helped also my digestion problems, which I have had since the age of 11.  My consumption of laxative teas was getting rather large.  Now I can go to the toilet daily and have lost a kilo.
