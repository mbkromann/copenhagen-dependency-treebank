We read with interest Robert Tomsho 's Sept. 28 page-one article on Robert Redford ( `` The Sundance Kid Gets Little Respect Around Sundance '' ) .
Misunderstanding conversations with us , Mr.
Tomsho argued that Mr.
Redford 's environmental views are at odds with Utah residents .
This may have been true 10 years ago , but times have changed , even in Utah .
Mr.
Redford no longer stands out as an extremist .
He has not changed , but those around him have .
Many of his views on the protection of wilderness areas , rivers and canyons are now embraced by mainstream , conservative Utahans .
Recently , some 60 environmental and outdoor groups representing such divergent points of view as the Sierra Club , the League of Women Voters and the National Rifle Association joined together to request a reassessment of the environmentally unsound Central Utah Project .
While Utah is not yet a haven for environmentalism , public views toward the environment have significantly improved .
In one of the most conservative , Republican states in the entire nation , the greening of Robert Redford 's neighbors is the real story that Mr.
Tomsho missed .
Sammye Meadows Sam Rushforth Gary Bryner Heber City , Utah If Mr. Redford wanted to be accepted by the people of Utah , he should have taken an advisory role instead of one of forcing his personal preferences .
Furthermore , his actions imply that it is too damaging or costly for society to provide jobs through power-plant construction , coal mining or to build roads for public safety because of the adverse impact on the environment , but it is just fine and dandy for him to transform a mountain high in the Wasatch Range into a ski resort .
It astounds me he can rationalize his self-righteous and greedy actions in Utah .
An excellent environmental actor he is .

Mr.
Redford , like it or not , is like a braking system on a runaway truck , kind of slowing it down into control .
He 's rich , famous and intelligent , and has the time to do something that not even the federal government will do .
Mr.
Redford is slowing down a mindless , speeding maniac known as the progress of mankind .
Personally , I 'm glad there are people like him around to slow down the profit takers , and those who are in such a blind hurry for something that may appear to benefit them in the immediate future , not caring about the long-range implications .
