Denmark's attitude towards China, since the dramatic suppression of the pro-democratic student uprising at the Tiananmen Square in 1989, has been simmering on a very weak pilot light.  China is still grounded, and Danida is keeping the coffers hermetically sealed on Danish commitments to China.

"The Chinese are disappointed at Denmark's attitude.  The Danes were among the first foreign business people in China, but now we are among the last to turn up again," says Oliver Jensen, FLS in Peking.

He says that development in southern China is going so fast that you lose your breath.

"We have great expectations for the reforms, although we are prepared that they might come in fits and starts.  But it is exciting to see how far they dare to go in unleashing market forces."

FLS has been active in China since 1906 and has established 20-30 cement factories, scattered around the country.  At the moment, they are about to build a facility in Shanghai, financed by a Spanish loan through FLS' sister firm in Spain.
