It has been demonstrated that g-days have an unreasonable impact on businesses with varying labor force requirements that cannot be evened out through scheduling.

For example, seasonal swings in certain businesses and weather problems that involve safety regulations for employees.  

Seasonal swings are due either to climate-related matters: harvest, sowing, etc., for equipment pools, etc., the nursery business), or customer preferences: Christmas trees, decorative greenery in forestry, cultivation of flowers for Christmas, Mother's Day, etc.

Within agriculture, the equipment pool area, forestry, gardening, nurseries, ground-keeping, etc., great efforts have been made to achieve a more even use of labor, but circumstances outside the employer's influence set limits for further improvements.

A study has shown that the two first employer-paid free days have led to a better planning of labor force consumption (for example, equipment pools), but additional opportunities for a positive regulation of behavior cannot be expected.

Since the deliveries of milk and pigs to dairies and slaughterhouses happen the whole year round, special problems arise in the summer period, when employees at processing plants, to a great extent, want to take vacation at the same time.  Dairies and slaughterhouses do not have the possibility for a "factory shutdown" 2-3 weeks in July, like many other businesses do.
