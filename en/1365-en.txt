It has always surprised people south of the border that a very short election campaign could be held in Denmark.

Three weeks after the Prime Minister called for the election, it can be held.

In Schleswig-Holstein, we need 70-90 days simply to take care of the formalities.  An election campaign is, therefore, held over a long period.  The present one just ended in August 1991.

Likewise, another surprise is the election broadcasts of radio and television.  Most of our German citizens cannot understand that each party receives the same air time on television and radio.  Minute or second democracy it is mockingly called.  I have also heard the expression north of the border.

However, I like this principle.  Each party that runs is to have the same chance, whether it is a completely new party that has never had representation in Parliament or it is the country's biggest party or the governing party.

Here, I meet stiff resistance from the large German parties, both in the CDU and the SPD.  The relative strength must be the decisive factor, they both say.  The largest party is allowed the most broadcasts before the election, and the smallest the fewest.
