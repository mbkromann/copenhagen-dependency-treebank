One of the reasons that this genre has become so lucrative is the altered status of science with the public in the last ten years.  In the 1970s, science was considered to be one of the pillars of established society - nuclear physics led to nuclear power and atomic weapons, molecular biology to gene manipulation, socio-biology to sex discrimination and racism, etc.  Scientists were henchmen of capital.  During the eighties, science acquired another more positive image: as supplier of answers to the great questions: When did the universe begin?  What is the place of man in evolution?  Is consciousness inside the cranium?  Is the Earth a dead rock with life on it - or a living thing itself?

Of course, contemplative researchers have at all times speculated about these topics.  But it was not until after the technology-optimistic '60s and the technology-critical '70s that the public caught sight of them again - and that a trend-catalyst such as Brockman could provide the tendency a name, voice and support.
