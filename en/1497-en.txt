When the Social Democrats gave up in September 1982, it was really also mostly on tactical grounds.  In the hope of quickly returning to the government benches, when the four clover government got bogged down.

BUT once again, it was a fateful misjudgment by leading politicians.

THE FOUR CLOVER GOVERNMENT was not a mayfly.  Under certain circumstances, it could even have remained in power today.  It is not even out of the question for it to turn up again.  Who dares to deny it.  At any rate, its formation became the start of a new phase in Danish politics after the Second World War.

THE HEAD OF GOVERNMENT bears a great deal of the honor for this, but a couple of other factors should, however, also be brought to light.

FOUR parties were in agreement on quite a lot, when the government was formed.  Far more than its opponents had believed was possible.  An important reason for this was that we all had an intuitive sense that the government's survival would depend on whether we had the courage to come up with a very radical proposal that would decisively alter expectations in the population and in business.
