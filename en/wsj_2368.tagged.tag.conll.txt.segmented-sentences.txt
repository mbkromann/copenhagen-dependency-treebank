The only thing Robert Goldberg could praise about CBS 's new show `` Island Son '' ( Leisure & Arts , Sept. 25 ) was the local color ; unfortunately neither he nor the producers of the show have done their homework .
For instance : `` Haole '' ( white ) is not the ultimate insult ; `` Mainland haole '' is .
Richard Chamberlain dresses as a `` Mainland haole , '' tucking in a Hawaiian shirt and rolling up its long sleeves .
And the local expression for brother is `` brah , '' not `` bruddah .
'' And even if a nurse would wear flowers in her hair while on duty , if she were engaged she would know to wear them behind her left , not right , ear .
Sorry , the show does not even have the one redeeming quality of genuine local color .
