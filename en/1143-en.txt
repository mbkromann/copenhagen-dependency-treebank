Dogs and atomic fuel

Sweden has introduced a fee so high for transporting a dog along through Sweden that it must be deemed prohibitive.  Therefore, it is with wonder that you read that Sweden can freely transport radioactive atomic fuel through Denmark from Germany.  K. J.

The Royal Danish Orchestra regrets that TV 2 sent on August 26 a portrait of the head of the Jutland Opera, Francesco Cristofoli.  In that program, the end of the collaboration between the Royal Danish Orchestra and Cristofoli was discussed in very unfortunate terms.  We at the Orchestra regret this deeply, since it involves an event that is some thirty years ago in the past, and since it is a quite natural process for an orchestra to participate in the choice of its conductors.  We would, however, like to use this occasion to express our true recognition of the great work that Francesco Cristofoli has done as head and conductor of the Jutland Opera.  The board for the Royal Orchestra, Kgs. Nytorv, K.
