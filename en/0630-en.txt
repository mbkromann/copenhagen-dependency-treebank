Bruno claps father nice and hard on the shoulder, so that he falls down to one leg.

-  Well, yes, okay, we're tired, too, answers father, who does not have the energy for more.

Henning has not run out of steam after his bath.  He is running round and round with Dolly's bra flying like a banner behind him.  Dolly and the other girls are sitting laughing and whispering together on the terrace, while I, silent as a housecat, squeeze myself in through the door and disappear.

A bit later, father and Dolly come upstairs to the room.

It is difficult to fall asleep.

The whole time, a branch is banging against the gable window.

At some point or other, I must nevertheless have dropped off.  And when I wake up again, my father is standing with his legs apart in the middle of the floor, coughing, because the fire is still glowing and, every so often, soot and smoke blow into the room, when the wind comes down into the chimney.

-  They've run off, dammit!  Dolly, they are gone!
