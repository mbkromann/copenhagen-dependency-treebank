After over a week's flight from police and social authorities, little three-year old Pernille is once again legally together with her mother, Yvonne Sølyst, 22, and grandparents, Ulla and Leif Nielsen.

Pernille will be permitted after all to live at home with her mother, even though the municipality of Ejby determined a month ago that she was to be forcibly removed.

Yesterday, the municipality of Odense quite simply reversed the decision.

"We won, and the municipality of Ejby lost the fight over Pernille.  It was truly good we did not just hand over Pernille and behave like law-abiding citizens," says Leif Nielsen, 43.

Last week, the grandfather wound up spending two days in Kolding jail, after having been arrested for suspicion of knowing where his grandchild was hidden from authorities.  But three unanimous judges of the Eastern High Court quickly set aside the custodial arrest.

And on Wednesday, public authorities in Ejby suffered yet another defeat in the much debated case from Funen.

Because of Yvonne Sølyst's new address in Odense, the child welfare authorities in the city were supposed to make the determination of forcible removal from the same material from which the social services committee in Ejby had made their assessment.
