Elise Gug's workplace is in the heart of the family's apartment, side by side with the kitchen-family room, which she believes must be one of the most photographed kitchens in Denmark.  Elise Gug also has a flair for interior decorating, and she could well imagine devoting her next life to that.

- For me, the greatest luxury is to come home with a really nice home decor magazine and curl up on the sofa with a cup of café au lait.

The apartment is in a converted former police station in a cozy housing co-op in a building from the 1700s with Mediterranean balconies, half-timbering, and a view of the Marble Church in Copenhagen.  The beautifully restored building is everywhere teeming with children - Elise Gug herself has three - and the housing co-op is so fond of social fellowship that has its own café and assembly room.

The feminine and romantic Gug-ian stamp is also clear throughout the apartment, which is decorated with lots of old furniture, second-hand finds and drapes.
