IT is apparently a KTAS tactic to send "the second string" to the front, when the fat is in the fire.  The KTAS management should understand that this tactic - "forward boys, I'm coming right behind" - only works, if you do not meet with serious opposition.

Nor, apparently, has KTAS's management learned the old adage, "? that you can fool some of the people all of the time and all of the people some of the time, but you can't fool all of the people all of the time."

THUS, we have come to what this matter is really all about: A number of subscribers believe that they are being registered for services they have not received.

FOR the ordinary subscriber, these services fall, roughly speaking, into two categories: Ordinary conversations and special services, including the obscene so-called "moan and groan services".

LOOK, now I have been told that fornication can be both entertaining and good exercise, so let us not be outraged that this service is offered.  What worries me is that it apparently often occurs that both ordinary conversations and moaning and other services are registered to other subscribers.
