ANTHONY HOPKINS is not just evil and cruel.  He can also play the good guy.  He demonstrates this in FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA's new film on Dracula, in which HOPKINS plays the hero Van Helsing, who is to get the better of the monster.  Apropos the monster, the English actor has also gotten the better of his own, alcohol.  But before he succeeded in that, he was so far gone that, some mornings, he woke up and couldn't remember any of the night's travails.  "I could be in doubt as to whether I had murdered someone during the course of the night and had to go out and check the car to see if there was blood," HOPKINS says.

STEVEN SPIELBERG had to stage his own private adventure here recently.  His 23-year-old nephew Christopher had disappeared on a hike in the Los Angeles National Forest and, when the local police were forced to give up after two days, SPIELBERG himself put two helicopters into the hunt.  The nephew was found after a couple of hours.
