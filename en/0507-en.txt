At the Nørrebro Library on Guldbergsgade, they are trying to reduce the waiting time for reserved books by speeding up the process by acquiring them from several angles.

Thus, the library has initiated a close co-operation with Wiuff's Bookstore on Jagtvej.

In those cases where the librarians estimate that there will also be a demand in the future for a particular book, it will simply be bought from Wiuff, which in most cases is able to deliver it with one day's notice.

As soon as the book is received by the library, it is put into circulation.

Those employed at the library hope that "project book on time," which is financially supported by the municipality, will be a great boon to the library's clients.

The experiences that are garnered during the project period will form the basis in the future for the purchasing policy, so that the "book on time" principle can be maintained.

A couple of years ago, the Nørrebro Library introduced the NOW books - which is to say, quite topical books with a lending period of 7 days.
