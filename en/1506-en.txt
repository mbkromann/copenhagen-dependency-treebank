The Conservative Party is gaining on the other government party, the Liberals, before the government's 10-year anniversary in just under a week.

According to an Observa survey done by the analysis institute GfK for B.T., there is now only a one and a half percent difference between the two non-socialist parties.

The Liberal Party will lose 1.2 percent of the votes in relation to the straw poll at the beginning of June.  While the Conservative Party will gain 1.3 percent, shows the GfK survey, which was done on August 31.

Despite its progress, the Conservatives will still lose one mandate to 29, because mandates have become more expensive as a result of fewer wasted votes.

STILL BIGGEST

The Liberals can muster 32 mandates and are thus still the biggest non-socialist party.

If you look at the midfield of Danish politics, the Social Liberals will win 0.9 percent more votes than at the last straw poll.  The party will gain two mandates and has today eight.

The second most important centre party, CD, will, according to the GfK survey, have the lowest result since the parliamentary election of December 12, 1990.  CD will 0.7 percent in relationship to the last straw poll and, with a total of 3.8 percent of the votes, the party will be down by seven mandates.
