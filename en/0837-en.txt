Several bank employees tried during the annual general meeting to encourage the shareholders to "share sun and rain equally with the employees."

On behalf of the personnel union, JÃ¸rgen Vetter said that the employees were agreed on the goal of a better bottom-line result and a better consolidation.  "But the means are wrong, since the personnel reductions will curtail the bank's service to the customers," he said.

Several shareholders complained about bad service and many mistakes, but they would not go along with a lower profit.

No rescues

It also emerged from Poul J. Svanholm's account that Den Danske Bank would not intervene and save distressed banks and savings banks that had come into financial trouble.

"Should less healthy or, perhaps, less well run financial institutions come into difficulties, they mustn't expect that Den Danske Bank will automatically be ready to step in and cover losses in other financial institutions," Den Danske Bank's chairman stated.

Svanholm drew a gloomy picture of the situation in the finance sector.
