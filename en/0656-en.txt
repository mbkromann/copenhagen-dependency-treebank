You could also experience the recall of reminiscence, which is a pleasant phenomenon, in Poul Jørgensen's excellent pictorial collage "Queen for 20 years".  Then, you would miss out on - or whatever it's called - Højlund Assembly Hall, which had put two incommensurable items on the agenda: "Sports and Spirits".  Do they belong together, it is put in a bold question - and, of course, they do.  There is nothing like a little active sport to give rise to a healthy and natural thirst.

"Queen for 20 years" marked, as the title indicates, the Queen's anniversary.  It is today and congratulations to us all for that.  It must not be easy to be queen with the colour, the circulation-wise more conspicuous part of the press has.

The broadcast provided good pictures from later chapters of our common history book.  There could have been more pictures, because it is - exactly - very pleasant family TV, which also provided an edifying insight into the relationship between popular government and the monarchy and the enormous job the Queen does for the country.
