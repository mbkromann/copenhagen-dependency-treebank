He looked at me curiously.  When it rang, he went straight over to it.  I carried on with a cigarette.  My cool was coming back.


-  Fine bishop you have!  He shut the notepad.  That and the pen disappeared into a pocket.  -  He asked me not to scandalize you.


I nodded, as if there wasn't a single thing I wasn't in on and had control of.  The snootiness acts as a detoxification.  -  And you're just a nice guy who does whatever he's told?


-  Certainly not, he said offended, as if I had put his honor into disrepute.  -  There's something about the bishop's wife's uncle's first wife, who is now married for the second time to our managing editor-in-chief.  Did you get that?


-  No.


-  It doesn't matter.  He sent out a couple of threatening signals, if I told my readers about my find.  As if I could even think of that!
