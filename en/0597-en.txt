At the same time, this power has been demoralising.  Nothing is more dangerous for morality and a sense of justice than constantly being forced or enticed to identify one's private cause with the Great Cause and to interpret its triumphs as one's private desert, but criminalize all attacks on oneself as sacrilege, because they also strike the Cause.

Because Georg Brandes to such a unique degree came to act like this sort of catalyst, he was also subject, more intensely than most, to the dangers of power and the blessings of power.  It tempted him toward a growing vanity and sensitivity and threatened his self-understanding, so he ended his days as a grumpy old man, personally wronged because the world had indeed gone to hell, but it also elevated him and gave him wings and provided him with the satisfaction of not commanding anything other than language (and through it: the heart), by allowing him to develop this language into one of the richest, most beautiful and most vital in our literature.
