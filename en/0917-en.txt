The result for 1991/92 is marked by the group's large international investments in the food sector.  Especially within food and drinks, including sugar and alcohol factories, the earnings trend has been satisfactory despite low world market prices for sugar.  Only Frigodan, a producer of deep frozen vegetables, pulled the sector's net results in the wrong direction as a result of last year's disappointing pea harvest in Denmark.

No breakthrough for Nutrio

Food and drinks constitute approximately 40 percent of the Danisco group's turnover.  Grindsted Products, which produces food ingredients, has achieved an increase of 3.4 percent in the primary operating results at DKK 244 million.  A continued satisfactory development is expected.  However, the group management notes in its earnings release that the new Nutrio division in Haderslev has not yet achieved a market breakthrough to make the division profitable.

Problems with packaging 

The packaging sector is causing Danisco significant problems. Danish Paper Packaging, which produces paper-based packaging has especially disappointed. However, this has not prevented the company's director, Per LÃ¸kkegaard, from being taken into Danisco's group management with the responsibility for Danish Paper Packaging as well as Rackmann's Factories.
