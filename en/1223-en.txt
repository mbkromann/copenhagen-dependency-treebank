Cater-corner to the demonstrators, inside the pleasant warm surroundings of the Wimpy's hamburger chain, two men the same age are drinking coffee, while they fill out their lottery coupons.  They are two well-dressed Iraqi Kurds who speak almost fluent Swedish.  Both have lost their jobs within the last six months.  They have been in Sweden, since they arrived in 1986 as refugees.

"Unemployment in Sweden is very bad.  And it is difficult to get an education," they say.  The majority of their circle of acquaintances are now out of work.

"We don't expect to be able to get work now.  We play the lottery, instead," says one.  This time in good English, which is the language in which the querying Danish journalist can best make himself understood.

On the way out of Wimpy's, I make sure not to pay in Danish crowns.  For the first time, they are worth more than our neighbours'.

It is Saturday afternoon.  Expensively dressed JÃ¶nsson and Carlsson families are in herds sauntering in and out of the many luxurious shops in central Stockholm's Norrmalm quarter.  Just think that a dresser can cost DKK 18,000.
