Queen Elizabeth's perpetual demand for royal order in the ranks did not faze her two daughters-in-law Diana and Fergie, when they behaved "improperly" during the renowned horse race at Ascot in 1987.

In other words, they kissed far too many handsome young men and slapped some of them on the backside, even as the playful princesses had great pleasure in poking various men with their umbrellas.

"Dignity above all!" thundered the respected newspaper The Times on behalf of Queen Elizabeth.

DI IN BIKINI

But it doesn't take much before one is judged undignified in the British royal house.  A picture of Diana in a bikini in 1987 caused the press and royal house to go completely amok, because one does not display oneself as a royal.

Continual reprimands have helped as much as the proverbial snowball in hell.  Finally, the frustrated Fergie began to poach on Diana's preserves and began to go clubbing and travelling around the world on her own.
