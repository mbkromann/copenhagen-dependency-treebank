"I love TV commercials.  But everybody knows that, when Superbrugsen has a loss leader with three steaks for DKK 45, then it is ultimately the consumers themselves who pay for the good price.  Consumers are not stupid."

TIGHT BUDGET

As a consumer, Peter Gren Larsen's budget is also tight.  For a young freelancer suffering from compulsive shopping, credit is short.  And he has realised that it will be even shorter, when he and his girlfriend Cecilie Olrik become parents in March.

His debut in the film business suffered a sorry fate.  The film "Terrorboy II" was made in 1982 and is undoubtedly the Danish cult film that has been seen by the fewest people.

"Fortunately, there is only one copy and it is locked away in a secret place," says Peter Gren Larsen, who got all his friends to work as actors in the film of which he would prefer not to be reminded.

Since that catastrophic entry into the glamorous world of film, 29-year old Peter Gren Larsen has been getting his dreams of doing television and film more into shape.
