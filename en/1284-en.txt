Swedish and Norwegian newspapers also claimed yesterday to know that Stefan Rasmussen's days as hero pilot were close to being over.  But this is also denied by SAS, even though a Norwegian newspaper also had the SAS head Jan Carlzon as a source.  After a radio broadcast on Swedish radio, he was supposed to have said that "he is a hero today, perhaps something else tomorrow."
