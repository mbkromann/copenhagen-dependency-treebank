The press has begun to take notice of him.  His books are being reviewed.  The height was last year, when Jørgen Thorgaard had one of his most important authors, Vagn Predbjørn, on his television magazine program on books.  And he has had success with his poetry book club, issuing three new poetry collections every other month.

Now the word "success" may not be quite the same for Jørgen Fallesen at Almind as for Gyldendal - at least, not measured in print run.

The number of members in his poetry club is 15 - fifteen - and even though he recognises that "this number is nothing to write home about," these fifteen are nothing to sneeze at.  "They have an important share in ensuring that the series can continue in spite of everything," he says.  There are no institutions or libraries among the subscribers, just individuals.  And the print run is normally in the100s, including review copies and free copies to authors.  He mentions Parzival as one of the "staple articles" - and, of it, there still go 75 copies of a year.  Therefore, he has also felt called upon to reprint it - in 100 copies.
