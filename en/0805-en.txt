The collection of his articles and lectures over the last ten years reveals that the world is lacking the genuine article, the novel.  Still, it has resulted in an incredibly beautiful book that shows us Rushdie as an eminent reader and interpreter of fantastical literature in particular, as created by the 3rd world's greatest novelists, Gabriel Garcia Márquez and Mario Vargas Llosa, or their European relations, Italo Calvino and Günter Grass.

Interspersed with heavily experience-based commentary on the political situation in his homelands India, Pakistan and Great Britain and essays on religion, especially Islam, that can provide slightly too cocksure material for reflection. 

Rushdie is part of a very strong English tradition for gifted journalism - albeit, in a complete misguided critique in one of the essays with direct reference to this genre's modern and unsurpassed master, George Orwell.  This is because Rushdie apparently reads Orwell through the British leftist tradition.  And of all leftist radicals, the British are the most hopeless.
