Shouldn't we for a little while leave Woody Allen's ravaged private life in peace and instead occupy ourselves a little with his film "Shadows and Fog", which has its premiere next Friday at Dagmar Theatre in Copenhagen and Biografen in Ã…rhus?

"Shadows and Fog" ("Shadows and Fog") takes place in the 1920s in a European village which is ravaged by a mystical murderer.  He strikes, when the weather is as described in the film's title and, apparently without motive, he strangles his victims with a piano wire.  It affects the attendance at a circus, which is visiting the town, while the local brothel is still diligently visited.  

In the village lives a little man with the appropriate name Kleinman.  He is awakened in the middle of the night by a group of men who have decided to form a vigilante group, and they want Kleinman as a part of a plan, content of which poor Kleinman never gets to learn.  So, confused, he wanders around like a bull in a china shop.
