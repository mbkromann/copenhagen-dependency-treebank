AT most educational institutions, the level of activity is easy to gauge from the start of the education.  If a student takes part in classes, assignments and tests, they are active.  If not, they are inactive.

WHERE there is no required attendance, there will, as a rule, be homework and the like, which makes it possible to gauge the level of student activity, and there are mid-term examinations in all studies.  How to gauge student activity is up to the educational institutions.  I have no reason to believe that the institutions do not take this job seriously.  In the nature of things, there is a possibility of cheating during the first year of an education.  Therefore, I want to introduce a provision to require institutions to conduct its first assessment of activity no later than 6 months after the beginning of the education.

JENS Sandfeld SÃ¸ndergaard claims that the student assistance rules are so lax that you can get from DKK 3,198 to DKK 38,376 a year without showing up in a classroom and without opening a book.  As an example, it is stated that if a person earns DKK 300,000, the relevant person can receive educational assistance for one month.
