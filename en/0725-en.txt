Everywhere in the technologically developed part of the world, they recognise the problems that people's uninhibited desire to copy creates for original productions.  Only not in the Danish Conservative Party or on the editorial board of Berlingske Tidende.  I find it deeply depressing that, in a matter of principle such as this one, non-socialist Denmark assumes a posture with robotic inanity in the front against creators, practitioners and producers of music and video programmes, whose contributions play an incredibly large and important role in people's everyday life.

It is difficult to understand why the Social Liberals and parties to the left apparently have obtained a monopoly on conducting an offensive cultural policy.  This is reminiscent of the inertia with respect to innovation in the environmental area that, for many years, characterised the non-socialist side in the halls of Parliament, which only at a late point had to acknowledge that habitual thinking had to be replaced by something new.  May the Conservative Party and the editorial board of Berlingske Tidende one day, too, come out of the caves, when it comes to cultural policy in an electronic world.
