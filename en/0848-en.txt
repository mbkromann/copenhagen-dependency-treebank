Passage across the Great Belt was opened to general traffic on December 1, 1883.

Not until more than half a century later did the first serious attack on the dominance of ferries in Danish waters come.  It happened on May 15, 1935, when the Little Belt Bridge was dedicated.

In three and a half years, a significant portion of DSB ferries will have to seek new waters, when the Great Belt connection is a reality.  And is thus an exciting story

by being history.

Five DSB routes will survive.

The DSB's ship division is looking for new markets in the eastern part of the Baltic, because in the year 2005 only five of the existing ten services will be intact.  Those surviving are Esbjerg-Fanø, Bøjden-Fynshav, Kalundborg-Samsø, Helsingør Helsingborg, though quite reduced, and finally Gedser-Warnemünde.  The gloomy prognosis is based on the consequences of the permanent connections over the Great Belt, the Sound and the Baltic.  These consequences will emerge for the Great Belt in 1996, 1997 or 1998, for the Sound in the year 2000 and in the Baltic in the year 2005.  Most of DSB's 34 ferries will then be superfluous.
