RALLY ROUTE

A half-year after the cancellation, René Metge was standing on the hood of a dirty Land Rover, which had now been used for the planning of four long-distance raids, and staring out across the open landscape, which would be a part of his transcontinental rally route.

He pointed out across the windswept crests of grass on the expanses of the former Soviet republics of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan - less than 350 km from the Afghan border.  And he seemed very intimate with the terrain, with which he has grown familiar through four years of thorough planning and reconnaissance.

He looked at his curled and worn map, jumped into his Land Rover and snatched the radio telephone:

"Sasha, I think we need to set the course a little more towards the left," he said in broken English.

Sasha Rusinov is a former doctor and Metge's right hand.  With a peculiar blend of French and English fragments, he answered from his car further away:

"No, Renney, I think it is better to keep a little bit to the right."
