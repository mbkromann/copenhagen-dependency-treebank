Another florist, Carsten Ove Dalsø Nielsen of Carsten's Flowers at Bredegade 55, Slagelse, has also had inquiries from the police. 

"I had been serving mulled wine to the customers, but now I have to drink what's left myself.  Despite the fact that I'd rather maintain the tradition.  The police action seems ridiculous.  The officers should have other things to do in a city like Slagelse, which is certainly not free of vandalism or other forms of criminality," says Carsten Ove Dalsø Nielsen.

Nor have a number of styling salons in Slagelse escaped, because they make their customers comfortable.  Not only a Christmas time, but the whole year with coffee, tea and cookies, while people are either waiting their turn or sitting for an hour with curlers in their hair or under the hair drier.  WHAT ABOUT THE NEWSPAPERS?
