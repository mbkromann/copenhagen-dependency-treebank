"Decided is saying too much, we didn't have any choice.  If we had not gone to work, the job would have been opened up to others and then at least 150 critical people would have come in again, and the 42 on the firing list would have lost their notice period," said Bjarne and Max, immediately after the morning's joint meeting.

The two are on the original firing list, which at the moment has been withdrawn, while management and union spokespersons try to find alternative solutions.

Gradually, as the names of the 42 fired leaked to colleagues, no one was any longer in doubt that the management here at the slaughterhouse was on a witch hunt against some of the employees who had been difficult in the past.

Bjarne and Max are sure to get laid off at any rate, so they are no longer reticent in expressing themselves but with many others the attitude is different: "We don't want to be the next to be fired."  And the sight of a journalist's pad makes the group scatter at once.
