There are two types of antifreeze on the market.  Monoetylenglycol and Propylenglycol.  Monoetylenglycol is normally green or blue, and with a 50% blend of water provides security against freezing temperatures to approximately minus 40 degrees.  Propylenglycol is red/pink and with a 50% blend with water provides security against freezing temperatures down to approximately minus 30 degrees.

The difference between the two products is, first and foremost, the degree of security against freezing temperatures and, beyond that, monoetylenglycol is more toxic than propylenglycol and, therefore, it is important that people do not blend the two products.  In the event they are blended, it is impossible to determine the point at which there is security against freezing temperatures.  There is no difference in the products' ability to fight corrosion - either in small or large engines, whether it is diesel or gasoline makes no difference, nor there aluminium parts are used in the engine - but since the additives that fight corrosion break down, the antifreeze must at least be changed every other year.

In recent years, people have become more attentive to impurities that arise in diesel fuel tanks: in everyday language, "diesel plague".
