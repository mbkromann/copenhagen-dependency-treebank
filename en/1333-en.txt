The discovery of a dozen needles in the body of a two-year old girl made the personnel at Roskilde County Hospital sound the alarm with the police.

The x-rays of the little girl's body revealed that she had been used as a living pincushion and, among other things, had needles in her lungs.

"It is a mystifying case in which small needles have been stuck into the girl's neck, wrists, and body and in the knee," informs criminal superintendent JÃ¸rgen Juul, Roskilde.

WEEKEND VISIT

The criminal police are investigating the sinister affair as a case of gross child abuse.  They do not yet know who has tortured the little girl

by sticking needles in her.

"But it is hardly the two-year old herself who has stuck the needles into her body.  We do not think so, at any rate," assures the criminal superintendent.

"We are interrogating the limited circle of persons around the girl and know that the girl has been on weekend visits with her biological father.  Otherwise, she lives with her mother.
