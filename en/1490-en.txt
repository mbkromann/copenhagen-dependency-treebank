The Jutland family man explained in court that he had never been told what he was accused of and that this had put a serious strain upon him, causing him to become ill.  He is today in contact with his children and has a good relationship with them and their mother.

The ethics board of the Danish Psychologists' Association has provided a declaration to the court in the case.  The board's overall assessment is that Sine Diemar will receive a sharp reprimand for not having acted in compliance with the Association's ethical rules.

In addition, Sine Diemar has insisted to her own organization that she believed that there was sexual abuse.  In light of this, she is obligated to inform the social authorities, but she acknowledges that she did not contact the municipality.

The claim of sexual abuse, therefore, was allowed to hang in the air, until the case was decided by the municipal court.  However, Sine Diemar has appealed the case to the Danish Western High Court.
