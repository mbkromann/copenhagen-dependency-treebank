Are they completely nuts? For several years now, S, SF and others have persecuted Ninn-Hansen, because in their opinion he has not followed the law.  There have indeed apparently been some problems, but there is nevertheless very wide-spread understanding for Ninn-Hansen's actions, because he safeguarded Danish interests without acquiring any person gain from it.  Now, we have a new Minister for Justice who follows the law, but it is the very same parties that will not stand for this.  They demand an amendment to the law - with retroactive effect.

Danes are not a race

The Danes are a people, not a race, so when the Danish Association advocates defending the Danish people against being displaced in their own country by economic refugees, the association cannot for that reason be accused of being racist, as claimed by director Jens 
Sejersen and in a completely mistaken judgment of the Gentofte Civil Court, which is defamatory of the Danish people.  Ivan Vaarby Laursen, Guldvej 6, 3060 Espergærde
