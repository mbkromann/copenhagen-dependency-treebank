- None of us had foreseen the difficulties we ran into, when we applied for permission to get married, says Lise Pedersen.  I was suddenly and without grounds fired from my job, and then the authorities tried with all their might to induce me to leave the country.  They asked me why I wanted to go on staying in the Soviet Union, when it was probably the worst country in the world.

They may have said it only to test my attitude toward communism, but we finally received permission to get married and did so in August 1983.

Despite their newly-acquired status as married folk, Lise Pedersen and Vladimir Pimonov were not left alone by the authorities, who now made it difficult for Lise Pedersen to extend her residence permit.  Lise Pedersen became pregnant and went home, and Vladimir Pimonov applied for an exit visa.  At that moment, he became a "refusenik" - a person who wishes to go into exile.
