Your precision - is there something about the felling axe that you transfer to the golf course?  "No, what I do in the forest is a craft.  My ball precision comes from all the balls I have hit, when I was a boy helping out.  It is effective.  I am employed by the JÃ¦gersborg Forest District, and I have gone to forestry school.  When you are a forester, you get a mini-forest-ranger education.  I go to work at seven o'clock, chop down trees, maintain tables and benches, cut the grass in the plantations and help select the trees that are to be cut down.  Then, I also help the caretaker in Raadvad City.  My house is a little forester's house behind one of the red gates.  I live here alone with six sheep, 20 hens and a German wire-haired terrier.

Mother and father also play golf.  They have a 20 handicap, that's really good, isn't it?  I have close contact with my family, I couldn't do without it.  They always back me up and help me.
