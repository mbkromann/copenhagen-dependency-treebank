The purpose of the experiment is to investigate whether raw oil is a blend or pure.

We try to distill raw oil with a simple set up as shown in fig. 9.9.

Fig. 9.9

We will discover that, after a short period of warming, a colorless fluid begins to evaporate from the raw oil.  We collect a tiny bit and will be able to detect the characteristic odor of benzene.  If we distill it more, we will see thicker and thicker fluid evaporate.

We can thus see that raw oil is a blend of a whole succession of different fluids.

When you bring raw oil up from the earth, you undertake a separation of the raw oil into its components at the same way as our little experiment.

At oil refineries, raw oil is distilled in so-called distilling plants.

In fig. 9.10 on the next page may be seen a diagram of a distilling plant.

We see here how many different materials of which the oil is composed.

But what is the difference between all these materials?
