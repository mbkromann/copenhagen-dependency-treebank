It was a very important and groundbreaking decision, because the naval effort is co-ordinated between the West Union and NATO.  With the deployment of European vessels, the West Union moves for the first time to the centre of European security after many years' debate about relieving the US burdens for the defence of Europe.

The involvement of NATO ensures that the force also has American participation, and thus the Atlantic perspective is maintained in European security.  The US is not excluded from this concrete task.

The dual consideration of the European defence pillar and the maintenance of the American commitment in Europe has stood its first important test.

So far, so good.  However, it is doubtful whether the victims of Serbia's and now also Croatia's aggression in Bosnia-Herzegovina have an eye for the finer political toolings in a decision to allow Western warships patrol the Yugoslavian coast.

First of all, the initiative has come too late.  It is more than three months ago that the Serbs began the war to annex a large part of Bosnia and forcibly deport several hundred thousand of its inhabitants.  Croatian forces are in the process of taking care of the rest.
