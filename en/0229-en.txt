Opinion surveys show that consumers prioritize the conditions in which chickens are raised almost as highly as the taste and far higher than fear of bacteria.  Swedish legislation as well as the concept behind the "Kronkycklinger" the poultry producer Kronfågel has exported to the Kvickly chain, therefore, show signs that the animals' welfare have been taken into consideration to a far higher degree than in Denmark.


More room

The difference between Danish and Swedish chicken production can be revealed simply by taking a single glance through the door of a Swedish chicken producer.  The chickens here have much more room.  In Denmark, the norm for producers is that - immediately before slaughter - there are 42 kg of poultry for every square meter.  In Sweden, the best producers are permitted 25 kg per square meter.  But only if they live up to a series of quality requirements.  Otherwise, the limit is 20 kg.

The government-employed veterinarian at Kronfågel's slaughterhouse in Kristiansstad, Karl 
Erik Bjørkman, stresses that shelter at the producer's means a great deal for the thriving of the animals.
