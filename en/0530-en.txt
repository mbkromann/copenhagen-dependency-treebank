OPENING


Before the UN's major environmental summit in Brazil next year, a half a hundred ministers are in Copenhagen this week.  They are discussing industrial development in developing countries, which can worsen global environmental problems severely.  The Ministerial Declaration, which will be issued officially tomorrow, however, is far too vague and general - say a number of environmental and aid organisations.  Here, the chairperson for the Danish Association for International Cooperation, Knud Vilby:

The defence ministers of the NATO countries will decide today and tomorrow to remove three-fourths of the tactical and short-range nuclear weapons, which the alliance has at its disposal today.  It is the largest nuclear weapons disarmament in the history of the alliance.  At the same time, the defence ministers are discussing a new strategy with less dependence on nuclear weapons. t-boret20
