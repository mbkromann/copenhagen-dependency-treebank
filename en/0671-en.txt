Over the years, the two Næstved schools each had a number of activities abroad; but, with the fall of the iron curtain, a collaborative contact was established, which has slowly developed and has now resulted in a joint offering of a series of common courses, taking place, in part, in Poland and, in part, in Næstved.

At a teaching centre in Gdynia, the schools had great success in the fall with a course for 34 Polish teachers from technical schools and business schools in the Gdynia/Gdansk area.

"The course included instruction on the building trade, a course in the use of computers, as well as management, marketing and organization.  We had many positive reactions and, in the evaluation two months later, we could ascertain that the Polish teachers had been able to use both the instructional method and their knowledge of the subject in their daily work," relates educational manager Niels Kjærsgaard of the Næstved Business School.

The contacts in Poland were made, inter alia, via the Næstved Business Council, which has established a counseling and co-ordination office through the company Næstved Entreprise in Næstved's sister city, Sopot.
