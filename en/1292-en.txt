"Actually, that is the problem.  Not that we haven't gotten them, but that the slightly "crazy" ones are not there anymore.  I'm thinking, for example, of Henning Dons, John Winther and Mikael Kold."

"They were so disciplined that they did not accept a defeat, before the last whistle in the game.  And they were tremendous at helping the young players in adversity.  Particularly Jon Winther.  Him I really miss."  "LANGE" IS HUNGRY

Have you focused too much on John Jacobsen?

"If I have, I have at least done so in the wrong way.  It mustn't be forgotten that it was due to "Lange" that we were even able to reach the semi-finals in the European Cup.  He played some excellent games for Kolding before Christmas."
