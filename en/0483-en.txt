He also says that the Danes' increased purchases of durable consumer goods is expected to be fully compensated by a fall in the sale of wine and beer south of the border as a consequence of the new Danish duty reductions.  "Before the duty increase, a discount beer cost DKK 3.25 in Denmark and 1.25 in Germany.  After the reduction in duty in October, the price is typically 2.25 in Denmark and 1.25 in Germany.  The smaller price difference that applies to beer and wine will reduce Danes' interest in purchasing these goods south of the border, even though it can be done in great quantities," says Jens Holger Helbo Hansen.  He adds that the price difference on spirits and cigarettes will also be reduced in the coming years, because the price in Denmark will be maintained regardless of inflation.


Discount beer at DKK 1.04.

The new rules mean, among other things, that after the New Year Danes can legally bring in at least 110 liters of beer, 90 liters of wine, and 20 liters of fortified wine.
