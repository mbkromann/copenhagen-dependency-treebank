The lady is named Irina Tweedie, is 83 years old, and lives in London, where the choreographer met her some years ago.  Tweedie's diary from India, where she met the Master, forms the background for the last and vivacious part of the show, where Randi Patterson has exploded the pristine boundaries of modern dance with song, exotic instruments and three authentic acrobats.

"Modern dance has become a quite limited form of expression, which is always threatening to close in around its own aesthetic, and that is why I'm trying to find something that can merge with dance and add some life to it.  Here, it is three buskers from Die Onkels, who come from a completely different world than that of dance with an immediate, more natural, physical and very powerful form of expression that the dancers lack," she says.

Randi Patterson adds that her experience of the limitations of modern dance may go together with the "fluctuating level" of the Danish dance milieu.

"You have to remember that dancers have incredibly difficult conditions in Denmark, and it will take a minimum of five years before a qualified milieu can arise, for example, around a new form of education in modern dance."
