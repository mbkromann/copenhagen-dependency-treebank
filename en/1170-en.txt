But Stenbjerre chose the totally commercial solution without distinction as to nationality, and the result was that Brüel & Kjær is today owned by Germans.

Now he is sitting on the board for the new Hafnia  -  Hafnia Holding of 1992 A/S.  A company where the red/white colours have also been particularly prominent.  Stenbjerre has been the legal sparring partner of the partners Lavesen and Grues in the difficult situation since June 2 and also the legal architect behind the solution that some call ingenious.  A chess move that with one blow brushed away creditors with a debt of DKK six billion.

However, the situation was not quite so simple and un-nuanced.

"In this case, you cannot separate law and practice.  If an asset is sold in the new company, an individual assessment must be made each time of what the money is to be used for and, here, of course, an eye must be kept out for the interests of the owners in the old Hafnia Holding", says Henrik Stenbjerre, referring to the fact that the supervision in Hafnia Holding must also be involved.
