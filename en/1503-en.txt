The clubs that sell out of the popular idols and do not have enough to offer at tournament matches have problems.

If the athletic performance is not good enough, then the sport's very fickle fans stay away.

Therefore, an additional question is also relevant:

Is it wise to schedule the return game in the Europe Cup tournament of champions at Parken with the 40,000 spectator seats?  

BRUISES

Assessed soberly, the Lyngby players return home next week with some athletic bruises from their "clash" with the Glasgow Rangers' Scots at Ibrox.

How many can then be enticed to a return game at Parken at prices between DKK 100 and DKK 500 14 days later?

Ticket sales begin on Monday.

"It is being moved from Lyngby Stadium in order to provide the players, the press and spectators optimal conditions" states Claus Nielsen.

And this is an excellent aim.

But the location is hardly enough to get a profit going.

Purchasers want a certain guarantee that there is a prospect for entertainment value and an excitement factor at a football event.
