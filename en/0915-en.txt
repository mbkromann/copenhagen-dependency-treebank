Much of the medicine that was introduced in the 1980s has provided an opportunity to treat diseases that have never before been able to be treated with medicine.  Or has provided better treatment for certain cancer types, treatment of ulcers without surgical intervention and sick leave, medicinal treatment of psychic ills, thereby making extensively superfluous psychiatric hospitals, better treatment of diabetes, etc.

The savings to society that follow quite naturally in the wake of this therapeutic progress are not immediately visible in the general accounting.  But it is a fact that new innovative drugs contribute toward minimising overall health costs, even though in the future new drugs will also still be more expensive to develop and market and, therefore, also more expensive to buy.

A good example of this is the marketing of drugs against ulcers.  Before these drugs were introduced, treatment of an ulcer cost US 720 dollars in the form of expenses to doctors and hospitals.  With the use of ulcer drugs, the overall treatment cost was reduced to 220 dollars, a decrease of 500 dollars.  In addition, there are savings as a result of reduced absence from work, etc.
