JACOB ASBÆK is the happy man of the week.  Here with his sons, PILOU, 10 years, MARTIN, 17, and THOMAS, 19. Asbæk has just received permission from the Spanish authorities to build a large 7,000 square metre per floor cultural centre on Majorca.  The building is budgeted at DKK 100 million.

LILLE PALLE, right, who has success on Bakken's open air stage, came with a kiss on the cheek and a red rose for his colleague, Bakken singer TOVE PEDERSEN, when she was honoured with Bakken's Oscar, a large and distinguished Bjørn Wiinblad platter.  She also received a kiss from her husband CHRISTIAN, who named a rose "Diligent Tove", after his wife.  That Tove is diligent is a well-known.  Not only does she sing at Bakken's Hvile.  She also does the serving with Bakken restaurateur BENT AXEL HASEBART, and, in recent years, she has written three books.  One and all are a paean to Bakken.  Her husband Christian Pedersen, bottling manager at the Breweries reveals that Tove is so diligent that she sometimes even gets up in the middle of the night, works for an hour and then goes back to sleep.
