How is it really with us?  Are we so sanctified that we can sit around on our laurels?  We can afford it, we have the know-how, we have the world's best environmental law and water environmental plan.  We also teach about the environment in the schools, we have grassroots movements and the right to express ourselves freely about problems.  But we are also great consumers and thereby a great burden on the environment.  So, even though our coastline on the Baltic, the Belts and the Kattegat is quite small, every Dane burdens this marine environment much more than any Pole or any Soviet citizen.  There is thus good reason for us to do a lot in Denmark to improve the environment.  But it would be even better, if all the countries around Baltic were part of such an effort.  We have a large common problem that must be solved together.


Our active co-operation.

In the spring of 1990, Rungsted High School, together with five other Danish schools, was invited to be part of an international environmental education project: the Baltic Sea Project.  Together with schools from all the other Baltic nations, we are to study the environment of the Baltic Sea for a five-year period.
