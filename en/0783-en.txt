The two periodicals, the Aalborg Local Gazette and the Funen Local Gazette, will form a common editorial board in Copenhagen, which is to provide material to both papers.

"We have recognized that, in order to get a better quality in the overall material, local papers have to merge," says the Aalborg Local Gazette's responsible editor-in-chief and managing director, Erling Brøndum.

"We want more quality material of general interest in areas we ourselves have difficulty covering," he says, pointing to, among other things, international topics and lifestyle topics - dealing with, for example, house, garden, boats and cars.

In the country's third local gazette, they are at the moment negotiating cuts, and this is the reason that they do not yet want to be part of the collaboration.  "We must first have a complete overview of our finances.  But I expect that we will join later," says Erling Zanchetta, who is the managing director for the Århus Local Gazette.

The common editorial board will be established by taking over a part of the Bergske News Service.  It was yesterday declared bankrupt, as was its owner, Klaus Riskær Pedersen, pursuant to a petition by the trustee, attorney Michael Rostock.
