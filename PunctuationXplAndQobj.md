## Punctuation Xpl And Qobj ##

**Special analysis for xpl and qobj sentences**

In the case of one govenor taking a sentence as xpl (which normally requires a colon) or a qobj (which normally requires a quotation), it seems that the end-sign of the xpl or qobj sentence replaces the end-sign of the governing sentence. This is particularly obvious if the end-sign of the xpl or qobj sentence is a question mark or an exclamation mark: It does not make sense to attach a question mark to a non-questioning sentence. Even though this only shows, when the end-sign differs from that of the governing sentence, it is natural to let the end-sign attach to the head of the xpl or qobj sentence, even when this is a period. So if an xpl or a qobj is a full sentence, the end-sign should be attached to the head of the xpl or qobj sentence, like this:
