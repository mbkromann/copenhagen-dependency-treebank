## Adjectival Objects ##

Adjectival complements bear the dependency label aobj.

  * Han kørte **træt**.
  * De for **vild**.
  * Hunden gik **amok**.

An alternative is to treat these as predicative complements (pred). There are two arguments against this analysis. First, these verbs do not accept the full range of predicative complements (PPs, NPs, adverbials, present participles etc). Second, the semantics is not (always) predicative: "De for vild" ~/~&gt; "De er vild(e)". Another alternative is to analyze the adjective as a particle (part).

Some further examples:

  * tage noget alvorligt
  * have det godt/dårligt/vidunderligt

An alternative is here, too, to analyse "alvorligt" and "godt" as pred, but these constructions are not truly predicative: "noget er alvorligt" is not the correct analysis (since you can take something funny seriously) and neither is "det er godt" the correct analysis.
