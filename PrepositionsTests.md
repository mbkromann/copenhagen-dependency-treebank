### Tests ###

Tests for determining whether an adverb and a following PP form a phrase, or if they modify the verb separately:

  * **topicalization test:**
    * Adv+PP is a single phrase, with the PP as the dependent of the adverb, if Adv+PP can be topicalized jointly (possibly after the insertion of other modifiers)
    * Adv and PP are separate phrases if Adv or PP can be topicalized separately, but not jointly (possibly after the insertion of other modifiers)
    * the test is indeterminate if neither Adv, PP, or Adv+PP can be topicalized  In "Vi gik op på loftet", "op på loftet" is one phrase because "Op på loftet gik vi ikke" is possible. In "Lyset gik ud i stuen", "ud i stuen" consists of two phrases because "**ud i stuen gik lyset ikke" is not possible, although "i stuen gik lyset ud" and "ud gik lyset i stuen" are possible.
  ***insertion test:*** Adv+PP consists of two phrases if it is possible to insert an adverbial between them without changing the meaning, otherwise it consists of a single phrase  In "Vi gik op på loftet", insertion is not possible (without change of meaning): "vi gik op i dag på loftet". In "Lyset gik ud i stuen", insertion is possible: "Lyset gik ud i dag i stuen".**
