Britain was warned to brace for further heavy snow, travel chaos, closed schools and widespread disruption as forecasters said sub-zero temperatures would continue across most of the country.
The Transport Secretary Philip Hammond is demanding an immediate audit of the UK's preparedness for the icy blast and a report on the levels of grit after a day of gridlock on the roads, airport closures and train cancellations brought large parts of the country to a standstill. 
The Met Office said milder weather was losing the battle against the cold front which had moved in from Scandinavia. Although snow would die out out towards the weekend, temperatures would continue to fall, reaching as low as -21C in the Highlands and -4C in London. "For most of the country there will be no let-up until next week. Even where there is no snow severe frosts and penetrating frost will be a constant hazard," a spokeswoman said. 
Despite more Arctic storms sweeping in across the South-east from Continental Europe overnight bringing up to 30cm of fresh snow, Gatwick airport said it still hoped to resume flights today after frozen runways forced it to close all day yesterday. Edinburgh airport, which is experiencing the worst snow in 40 years, was also shut with the cancellation of 300 flights. Passengers were warned that they were likely to face further severe delays even if the airports did re-open. 
In England, more than 3,000 schools were shut yesterday with many warning of similar closures today which will mean hundreds of thousands of parents will have to work from home or make alternative childcare arrangements. The Department for Education issued advice to headteachers urging them to keep schools open where it was safe to do so.
