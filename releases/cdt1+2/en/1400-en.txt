A Danish recognition of Macedonia must, however, be voted on with the other EC countries and, here, Greece is resisting fiercely.  The Greeks will not recognise the name Macedonia, which in the Greek view is the designation of an area of the northern part of Greece.

While the civil war rages and the politicians negotiate, Anders Dahl Rasmussen continues to sit in his cell in the Scremska Mitrovica prison approx. 65 km west of Belgrade.

He does not speak Yugoslavian and, for two and a half years, has had no visitors other than Yugoslavian lawyers and diplomats from the Danish Embassy.

"I visited him as late as last week, where he seemed to be doing reasonably well.  He is receiving medicine for his diabetes and circulatory problems and supplies us each time with long shopping lists for papers, cigarettes and foodstuffs," says the Danish charge d'affairs Joachim Rehder to B.T.

"Among other things, he asks us to buy onions, tomatoes, sausages, tea and margarine, because the prisoners have also been touched by the civil war.  Here in Belgrade, it has become more difficult to get food, and it is beginning to become scarce with goods like sugar, cooking oil and gas," adds the diplomat.
