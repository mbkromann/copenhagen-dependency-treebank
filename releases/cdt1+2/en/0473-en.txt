Something Happened is the name of a novel by Joseph Heller.  The same can be said about the relationship between children and adults, educators, teachers and students.  For some, "what's new" has come quite unexpected; for others, as a logical consequence of one of the greatest blunders of our time, when it comes to the care of our young.

What are we talking about?  We are talking about the many children who constitute one of the biggest problems in public schools today, the ones we call disruptive children, the small ego-trippers, the ones who are always in your face all day long.  We meet them on the street jeering, noisy, self-promoting, articulate, fiercely argumentative.  All those who apparently have so much self-confidence that they are above any criticism.

What's new for the poor teachers, who as everybody knows have had to bear the brunt of the burden for the past twenty years, is that these disruptive problem children do not come from the usual problem homes, i.e., broken families, social losers, the ostracized, the cowed and the abandoned.
