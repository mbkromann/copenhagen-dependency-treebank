In Korovabad, where three soldiers had been stoned and beaten to death, 60 Armenian houses had been burned down by raging Azerbaijani groups.  Eighty Azerbaijanis had been arrested by a military garrison, and an investigation of the episodes had been commenced.

The Armenian source denied reports in Moscow and Paris that many Armenians had been killed.

-  No Armenians were killed in Kirovabad.  The Armenian neighbourhood will probably be guarded by soldiers.  Armenians who live in other districts had been brought there, he said.

The spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry, Gennady Gerasimov, also said that none had been killed beyond the three soldiers in Kirovabad.  He said that the curfew had helped, and that it was quiet in Kirovabad.

In Baku as well, it seemed to be quieter, even though soldiers in armoured vehicles and trucks patrolled the streets, and there were demonstrations in the centre of the city, informed a spokesman for the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry.
