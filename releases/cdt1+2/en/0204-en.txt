The decisive new thing in gene splicing is that they can transfer hereditary traits from one species to another.  In this way, they have, for example, created a giant mouse.  The giant mouse was constructed by transferring part of a rat's genetic "growth traits" to a mouse.  The result was that the mouse became almost as large as the rat.

In the factories we have today, raw materials are transformed into new products.  Soybeans become salad oil.  Wood becomes paper.  In the factories of the future, it will be gene-spliced organisms that transform raw goods into products.

And Danish industry is in the foremost ranks of this technological development.  In 1987, they expect to able to start the first production with gene-spliced organisms.  All the forecasts and foreign experiences say that it will not be a long time between the first production using gene-splicing and the next.  Research is being done in countless areas, and there are many results that indicate promising productions in Denmark and abroad.
