It is the Danish divisions of large multinational companies that spend millions on TV-2 spots.  ABBA "Gold" has been advertised massively on television, just as AC/DC and other "greatest hits" are.

"I think TV advertisement campaigns harm Danish rock quite a bit.  We know from experience that there is a large block of the audience that only buy three - four records a year.  And whereas before they might have bought Kim Larsen, Anne Linnet, TV-2, they now buy what they see advertisements for on TV," says Stefan Fryland, chairman for the record company association IFPI.

But Fryland is also director for Polygram - one of the companies that advertise compilation records most extensively on TV, which may raise doubts about the sincerity of his statement.

"I realise that I'm wearing two hats and have two sets of accounts in this matter.  But it is also my own personal opinion that TV spots are harmful," he says.

There are no figures for how many millions of crowns the record industry throws into TV campaigns.  But a number of people believe that it provides food for thought that the total sales have nevertheless gone down.
