But their mutual relationship is complicated by the fact that they are both in love with the same man: the exiled and later returned Peder Oxe, whom Mette Rosenkrantz ultimately marries after her husband's death.

The novel does not go that far, even though it is the happy ending it sets the stage for - some of the finest writing in the long story is the description of how this mutual love hesitantly clears the path for itself.  But that "Saint Marcus Night" may be called Helle Stangerup's best novel - without it therefore needing to be her most popular! - is due, first and foremost, to the cool passionate brilliance with which she masters the complex of themes the novel's plot contains.  Time and its fates - female fates - cannot be separated.  Neither in their tragedy nor in their triumph.

It is not wrong that, on the back cover, "Saint Marcus Night" is called an account of the longing to understand the inconceivable, of the search for the impossible, of exceeding the boundary for all human ability.  So great an errand is Helle Stangerup also on.
