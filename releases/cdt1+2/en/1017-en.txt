At almost the same time as the Government's proposal of its bill, CD proposed a motion for the possibility for anonymous advice for children and parents, to which one can have recourse when there are problems - without it leading to "a report being made", which immediately makes someone into a case in the system.

This was conceived as a means to prevent problems that can still be solved with assistance from an impartial expert from being allowed to develop into something that can end in an unhappy forcible removal.

This was proposed as an amendment to the minister's bill, which was approved - but nevertheless without CD being able to vote for the law as a whole.  In CD's view, it had faults and omissions that made us consider it too incomprehensible that a non-socialist government would be a sponsor of it.

As undoubtedly everyone else does, CD puts decisive weight on the fact that forcible removals, when they are unavoidable, happen as cautiously as possible.
