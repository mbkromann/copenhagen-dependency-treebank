Popular support "Orlando has caused something of a revolution in Palermo," says Antonio Cimino from "The Co-ordinated Movement against the Mafia", an organisation that has started to fight organised crime in Sicily.  "He has tremendous support, particularly in the poorest neighbourhoods."

"I really respect Orlando," says Michela Buscemi.  Two of her brothers have been killed by the Mafia, and she testified in court against the suspected killers.  "He was the only one who extended a hand to help me."

"If Orlando disappears, I don't know what will happen.   He is our last hope," says Emilia Bonsignore.  Her husband, who was a member of Palermo's city council, was murdered two years ago, when he tried to reveal a criminal transaction in the amount of DKK 192 million, in which city council members were involved.

Such expression of popular support helps Senator Orlando to endure "my difficult life", as he describes it.

Another source of strength, he says, is the pressure foreign governments are putting on Italy to get its problem with organised crime solved.
