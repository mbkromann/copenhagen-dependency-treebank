The critical shareholder group consists, among others, of foreign-resident Danes, Finn Harald Simonsen, carpet dealer Ole Jensen and Riskær's former partner Peder Hauch.

Capital and reserves in the amount of DKK 483 million.

Klaus Riskær owns half of Accumulator Invest.  He has on several occasions emphasized that the company is financially sound and that he is affluent.  In the most recent accounts, the six-month report for the first six months of 1991, capital and reserves are reported even in the second accounting line to be DKK 483 million.

In the report from Accumulator Invest to the Danish Stock Exchange, it states that the shareholder group's request to convene an extraordinary general meeting is moot. That is the assessment of management at Accumulator Invest, referring to a certification from attorney Ebbe Mogensen of September 17, in which it is certified that the request has been withdrawn.

Villa, plane and cars

The shareholder group is dissatisfied that Klaus Riskær as chairman of the board has a DKK 27 million villa, a plane and several cars at his disposal, just as they express uncertainty with respect to Klaus Riskær's purchase of De Bergske Blade.  And the extent to which this investment has been kept off Accumulator's accounts.
