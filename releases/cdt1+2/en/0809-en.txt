Syria's President, Hafez al-Assad, began a tour of the Middle East yesterday to muster support for Libya - and for his own country.

Diplomats in the Middle East say that Assad fears that the sanctions - that the UN has introduced against Libya as a result of accusations that Libya supports and harbors terrorists - may very quickly be turned against Syria as well.

Assad's attitude is "today Libya - tomorrow Syria," said a diplomat.

The Syrian leader arrived yesterday at Abu Dhabi after a visit to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.  He is also expected to visit the other three members of the Gulf Cooperative Council (GCC) - Bahrain, Qatar and Oman - before he returns home.

Syria came to the aid of Kuwait, when the country was occupied by Iraq in August 1990 and joined the US-led alliance against Iraq, which forced Iraqi forces out of Kuwait again a little over a year ago.

Diplomats estimate that Assad will ask Kuwait and the other GCC countries to support Syria at a time, when Syria believes it has need of it.
