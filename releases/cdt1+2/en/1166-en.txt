More than every fourth employee will be gone.  Seven divisions are to be sold.  Large blocks of shares in the three provincial banks are to be sold.  The director is discharged, and the chairman of the board is leaving.  DKK 60 million is to be brought in through stock increases.

That is the situation at Varde Bank, which yesterday - with an unusual openness for the industry - launched the plan that is to save the bank's independence.

The new managing director, Kaj Thomsen, confirms that, from the bank's side, there have been feelers to other banks and talk of merger.

"But it has not been in the nature of negotiations.  We have always aimed at finding a local solution, and we have found one, too," he says.

The local solution is nine business people, who have formed a West Jutland consortium that will guarantee a stock increase of DKK 60 million.

This was necessary after a third quarter with a deficit of DKK 232 million and after the equity ratio - as Kaj Thomsen puts it - "came somewhat closer to 10 percent than we care for here at the bank."
