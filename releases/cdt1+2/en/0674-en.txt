Peter Bruun is looking for a collaborative partner.

To take the domestic market first, a Killer Whale hull with deck and hatch for about DKK 55,000 to a Grinde for about DKK 80,000 can be delivered.  The price for a keel is respectively DKK 9,000 and DKK 10,000, which may come with a mast from John Mast.  All the designs for templates for the keel, helm, and fittings and equipment are included.

On the export market, Peter Bruun is looking to collaborate with a well-established firm - in Denmark or abroad, or several firms, for that matter - for an expanded production of ready-made boats, depending entirely on the trend in the market, of course.  Abroad, it could be done by virtue of a licensing agreement for each individual country.

The two types of boats mentioned have been a clear success in Denmark for over 20 years now.  The distinctive cachet and sterling sailing abilities of "the whale boats" have appealed to many sailors; the boats are functionally well-formed, and they are spacious.  They are excellent tour boats and, in addition, the Killer Whale has particularly dominated in regatta racing and, year after year, been the strongest class of boats represented in, for example, "Zealand Round".
