"It was purely an accident.  But I don't know why."

The chief engineer on the Ask was Ole Rønnow, who was also chief engineer on Peder Paars.  He has been helping to ascertain for DSB that both the Ask and the Urd were sound ships.

DSB's controversial Kalundborg-Århus route is pursued by problems: The Urd yesterday afternoon had to have Århus Harbour's tugboat Hermes push it from the repair dock to the loading dock.

Route manager Ivan Madsen:

"I don't know why.  But it is probably, because it is the easiest way to get around the corner, and we have tugboats nearby anyway."

It costs DKK 15,000 to call a tugboat.

The explanation, which the route manager did not know, is that the Urd yesterday had ventured out towards Kalundborg.  One engine broke down, whereupon the Urd turned around and limped to Århus, because DSB has reserve parts there.

In the meantime, the Ask docked at Kalundborg, whereafter everyone could see that now the Urd was to start its route like the Ask.  Therefore, it was tugged to the loading dock, while it was still under repair.  And when everything was ready, the chief engineer went home.
