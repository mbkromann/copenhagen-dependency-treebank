It sounds like a lot, but an association of American mayors believes that there is a need for 35 billion dollars.

This cannot be done without a tax increase, which is politically impossible, or a drastic increase in the budget deficit, which would be very risky and politically dangerous. 

But neither does the Democratic Party yet know what it will do.  The Democrats in Congress have proposed job-creation programs, which they pretty much always do during crises, but without guidelines on how it is to be financed.

Bill Clinton has recently changed the subject entirely for fear that harsh criticism of the president will push white middle class voters away from the Democrats, as happened throughout the 1980s.  If Clinton has a plan for attacking urban problems, he is keeping it to himself at the moment.

The result has been opinion polls where the voters are divided into three almost equally large groups between Bush, Clinton and the likely third man in the election campaign, the extremely wealthy businessman Ross Perot from Texas.
