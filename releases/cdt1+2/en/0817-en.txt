The Social Democrats are unhappy that the chief public prosecutor Ole Stigel was appointed to investigate the DR charges against the police and the prosecuting authorities, because he was a prosecutor on the case in 1982. In a report that was sent to the Legal Affairs Committee, the chief public prosecutor and the attorney general "acquitted" the police on most points but found fault with the fact that the police did not respect the rules of civil procedure in that the person being interrogated must have the opportunity to read through their statement for the police report.  In a report to the Legal Affairs Committee, DR has since directed a scathing critique at the report that the chief public prosecutor and attorney general have made.  And this is the reason that the Social Democrats now demand a court of inquiry. 

"A court of inquiry is necessary to have confirmed or denied whether the charges raised against the police methods are correct.  No one is served, if the many accusations against police behaviour stand unrefuted," says Frank Jensen.

He can expect support from SF, where Ebba Strange says:

"We will not oppose an impartial investigation and can probably be persuaded to support such a demand, but I will not myself take the initiative."
