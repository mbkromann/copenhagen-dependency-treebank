In the dock sat six Danish seamen from the drug ship Nerma and three American co-defendants, struck dumb with tension. 

In front of them were their defence attorneys.  They all stared into the faces of the 12 jury members, who had been led in from the opposite side of the large, dark, ponderous courtroom.

The faces of the jurors were sombre and showed the heavy responsibility that had been imposed upon them four weeks ago and which was now to be translated into verdicts after 15 hours of exhausting voting.  Several of them had tears in their eyes, two middle-aged women in the first row of the two jury rows squeezed each other's hands, as the verdicts were read aloud by the District Judge Stanley Marcus' clerk.

"Not guilty, not ?

We find the accused Brian Rasmussen", she said solemnly, NOT guilty on count one, on court two: NOT guilty, on count three: NOT guilty, on count four: NOT guilty."

We find the accused, Bent Erik Mortensen", she continued, and repeated four times NOT guilty.  Bent Nissen: NOT guilty.  Martin Sten Rasmussen: NOT guilty.
