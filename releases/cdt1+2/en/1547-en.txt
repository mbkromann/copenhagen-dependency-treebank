He plays five roles in the successful production of "Hamlet" at the Betty Nansen Theatre in Frederiksberg:

He is a guard, actor, captain, body (without lines) and Fortinbras.

A 3Â½-hour production six times a week and, each time, about DKK 100 goes into his pocket.

Henrik Fiig, 27, is in his fourth and last year at the theatre school in Copenhagen, and his engagement in "Hamlet" can almost be viewed as a sort of apprenticeship.

It is his first real theatrical role.

Henrik is full of energy, but his acceptance to the theatre school was painful for him.

"I had a girlfriend at that time, with whom I had lived for two years, but the relationship went down the drain, when I started school.

I was confused, when all the opportunities at the school opened up for me.  There was a lot of experimenting.  You have to learn to know yourself, and it was so time-consuming that it didn't work out with a relationship.
