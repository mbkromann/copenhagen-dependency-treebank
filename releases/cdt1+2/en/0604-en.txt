Best idea of the week

Oil from the bicycle chain has a certain tendency always to get on pants legs.  Everybody knows how difficult this can be to get out, but if you buy a can of Motorrens at a gas station and spray it on the oil stain before washing, the pants will be fine again.

Cough your way to health

The cough is the body's attempt to remove excess mucus from the lungs, but often help is needed to break up the mucus particles.  Mucomyst soluble tablets are a new and recognised cough medicine that can be used for ordinary colds but that, at the same time, have proven to be incredibly effective for acute relief and in people with chronic bronchitis.  Mucomyst is also recommended for small children, since it tastes good and the ingestion of medicine can take place without any huge drama.  For diabetics, it is also ideal, since as opposed to most cough medicine it is completely without sugar.  Mucomyst may be purchased without prescription at the pharmacy.
