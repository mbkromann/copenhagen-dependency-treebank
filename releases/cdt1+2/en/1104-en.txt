"Hash is also a narcotic.  It ruins the quality of people's life and destroys people psychologically.  It is forbidden and should be forbidden to possess hash or to convey it, even if it happens free of charge.  Hash deserves just as thorough a police effort, as hard drugs are subjected to other places in the city."

For three weeks, the police in and about Christiania have charged 123 persons for possessing or dealing in hash, 19 kilos and DKK 82,000 have been confiscated, and 165 kilos of marijuana have been harvested at Christiania.  But the police have ascertained that Christiania is not living up to its old reputation as a fencing central.  That is gratifying, says Annemette MÃ¸ller, who calls hash the free state's "true scourge".

"We have now bolstered efforts against the open hash market, and we have received positive signals that some residents are satisfied with our effort.  These are forces that support a legalisation of Christiania and who realise that the free state cannot base its future and its economy on hash trade.
