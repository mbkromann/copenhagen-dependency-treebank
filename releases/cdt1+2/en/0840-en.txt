Appeal from the Presidential Council

The Yugoslavian Presidential Council appealed at the last moment to the UN not to put a boycott into motion and, instead, urged that an international conference on the conflict be called.

The request appeared in a telegram from the Council to the UN Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-Ghali.

But the Russian UN ambassador rejected the proposal straight away.

"We have heard all sorts of things from Belgrade for a long time," he said.  "But there is a limit to everything.  Now, they have to conform to the decisions of the Security Council.  Then, we can talk about a conference afterwards."

Letter to Bush

Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic also appealed yesterday to the US and Russia to use their influence in helping to bring the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina to an end, said Serbia's Foreign Minister.

Foreign Minister Vladislav Jovanovic said that Milosevic sent letters to the American president, George Bush, and the Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, just before the UN Security Council was expecting to approve sanctions against Serbia.
