What the Social Democrats believe about Denmark after the EC-no vote depends on who you ask.  The party is capable of supplying many interesting points of view.  At Christiansborg, the new chairman Poul Nyrup Rasmussen is endorsing the "official" viewpoint that we must not propose a solution before we have seen whether France and England will approve the Maastricht Treaty.  A negotiating tactic shared by the governing parties.

In Det Fri Aktuelt, Ritt Bjerregaard is encouraging a new referendum on something that resembles the Maastricht Treaty.  She does not even take cognizance of the referendum result, because there is no middle solution.  Either we're out or we're in, says Mrs. Bjerregaard.

A third prominent Social Democrat, namely, the dethroned chairman Svend Auken, is disseminating a third completely different point of view in the English Parliament's bulletin, Parliamentary Brief.

Here, he calls all the speculation about a new referendum pure wishful thinking.  Because: the Danish referendum is legally binding, and Denmark is therefore incapable of ratifying the Maastricht Treaty.
