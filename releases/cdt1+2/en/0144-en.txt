Day and night have been abolished here.  Twenty-four hours a day, the refugees are desperately fighting for one thing: Survival.  The strongest are out getting provisions.  The weak and the sick lie in their tents.  The green tents are the Pakistani model handed out, which is not very suited to this climate.  The majority are still living under plastic sheets or blankets, which they have stretched over some sticks as an improvised tent.  Bassam at 35 lives together with his nine children and 18 surviving family members.  28 people in all in a little tent.  He has severe kidney pains and is wrapped up in all the blankets that the family has been able to get.  At the same time, his uncle is on his death bed.  Bassam displays the medicine that the clinic in the village prescribed for kidney pains.  They are headache tablets.

Outside the tent, a little girl is sitting with an infant on her lap.  The child's cries are heart rending.  Its feet, which are not covered, are blue from the cold.  Without a diaper, the child's diarrhoea is running down over the girl's thighs.
