Torben Vest, who runs the clothes store Jørgen og Jørgine in the center adds: "In our first week of sales, profits were 20 percent under last year's and even though we are marking our prices even further down and spending more on marketing, it will probably end with a 10 percent decline for the whole sales period in relation to last year."

"Satisfactory if, perhaps, not quite as good as last year," it resounds uniformly from three clothes shops in Århus: Hennes & Mauritz, EBM Herretøj and Kaufmann i Århus, which have all had sales for a couple of weeks.

Daells Varehus sings the same tune: "We began the sale on June 22 and made a little extra out of it again yesterday, when the other large department stores in Copenhagen started theirs.  And yes, we are actually satisfied.  It has gone nicely, if a bit under the numbers for last year, but it was also quite, quite good," says marketing director Erik Schiøtt.
