Dear deeply confused

It is correct that child benefits and supplements for families with children will lapse.  On the other hand, her father can be made to contribute (as a rule, less than before the child turns 18), while the young person is at school.  However, only through the first real course of study.

Even though you dislike it, it is probably the best solution.  It is difficult for young people, since 3 G is an important school year.  It requires very high grades to be accepted by most higher educations, and a low grade average is really not worth much.  That in itself is an incredible pressure on our young people.

Therefore, it is difficult to see a solution in just advising her to get work experience alongside studying for exams.

Single providers of older children are even more poorly situated, since the rule that - as a parent of a student over 17 - you could have your standard deduction increased was done away with; this rule could have helped you.
