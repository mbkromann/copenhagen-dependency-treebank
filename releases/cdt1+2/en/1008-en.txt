In Gothland, the forest fire was so severe that, according to the Finnish news bureau FNB, the smoke could be smelled all the way up in southern Finland.  After several days' struggle with the fire, the civil defense resources in Gothland were completely exhausted yesterday afternoon.  The official on duty at the local emergency service said to the Swedish news bureau that extra material would be transferred to the island from Stockholm.

Yesterday, seven helicopters took part in the fire fighting operations in Gothland and there was a certain amount of optimism among the fire fighters.  The wind had subsided somewhat and the fire had stabilized.

Yesterday, some people who were evacuated on Friday from the city of Kr√§klingsbo were still quartered haphazardly with friends and acquaintances.  But many of them were given a brief opportunity to return home and get belongings.

The night before last, the fire department shuttled to the sea to get extra water.

According to reporters dispatched by the Swedish news bureau, the fire and the many plowed fire breaks created great gashes in the terrain, so that it resembles "a ghost-like, ravaged landscape."
