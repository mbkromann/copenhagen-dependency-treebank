Inger: "It is pure and simple envy on the part of the sports journalists, when they never mention championships in bodybuilding.  They're jealous that they don't have so muscular a body themselves.  You only hear about bodybuilding, when there are hormone scandals.  Even though these are exceptions.  It is also typical that, after the piece on us in "Eleva2ren" last Friday, they would have him, that Greenland guy, say something "funny" about our muscles.  "Wow, talk about hormone beefcakes."  They can't even imagine that we've gotten our muscles without supplements but by hard training.

"But what makes girls choose such a traditional masculine sport?" 

"When I was little, I dreamed of being a princess in taffeta and tulle, and I went to jazz ballet for many years," says Helle, who ordinarily runs the "Better Bodies" Studio in KÃ¸ge, where you can go to work out, do aerobics and do bodybuilding.  "It is really an accident that I started bodybuilding.  I began going to weightlifting and was encouraged to try it at the competition level."
