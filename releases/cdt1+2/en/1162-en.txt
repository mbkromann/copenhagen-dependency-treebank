Finally, it is important to "gear" the Danish projects toward Phare and to get them ready for financing through international institutions, including the World Bank and the European Development Bank (EBRD)," says Jens Erik Staalby, chief engineer at Birch &
Krogboe.

EBRD and the World Bank are often obliged to use the analyses and assessments of their own experts.

But the problem is that these experts are rarely technicians or engineers but, in most instances, economists.

"The banks have acknowledged this and, therefore, the special aid fund for Eastern Europe has agreed to individual support for Danish advisers' preliminary inquiries for both the World Bank and EBRD," says Jens Erik Staalby.

This will be done through so-called Trust Funds, through which the banks can draw on Danish experts for their preparatory missions.

A couple of examples: central heating in Poland (Danish Board of District Heating), health in Hungary (Danish Health Group and National Board of Health), central heating in Bulgaria (Birch & Krogboe and the Danish Energy Group).  The Dialogue Foundations will make sure that Danish technicians with Danish support money will be part of influencing the international bankers' future tender of shipments to Eastern Europe.
