Horsens Art Museum has since 1984 been housed in the Grove Pavilion.  It is a beautiful, approximately 150-year old building, the foundation of which was laid by the Horsens Civil Marksmen's Guild.  Since then, among other things, it has been a summer restaurant.  The museum is in the Caroline Amalie Grove, a large park with stately, old trees.

"The criticism misses the mark," says Claus Hagedorn-Olsen.  "The addition touches less than one percent of the park's area, and Horsens architects Niels Thorup Pedersen and Poul Schwartz were able to design an extension that fits in particularly well with the old building and, therefore, we can regard the criticism quite calmly."  Ready for a city jubilee 

If the construction goes according to plan, the expanded museum will be ready in November, when Horsens celebrates its 550th jubilee as a city. 

"And with the new setting, we have an excellent opportunity to make Horsens 
even more well-known as arts city, " says Claus Hagedorn-Olsen, who came to the city as a museum keeper in 1984, when the art museum moved into its own building in the Caroline Amalie Grove.
