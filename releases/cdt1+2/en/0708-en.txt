Chief of the Gønger fought its way last night through the sixth of the thirteen episodes on Radio Denmark television.  But the brave Svend Poulsen's tremendous energy did not succeed in getting the TV reviewers to surrender.  In today's paper, Jens Kistrup puts the question this way:

"Is it too much to talk of a national scandal?"

Every Dane has something to complain about in Radio Denmark's most expensive production to date.  Script, direction, dramaturgy and production have been in for it.  The plot itself disappears in big battles and love scenes - and the errors in details such as, for example, cabbage heads bursting with chemical fertilisers, dog species that did not exist in the 1600s and the series' slaughtered wild boar, which was clearly stuffed and pulled directly down from the trophy wall.

Sven in Gyngemosen has noted the criticism.  Gønge producer Sven Clausen is sitting at his desk in TV-City, putting the final touch to the 23rd episode of the series, whose episodes 15-26 are called Chief of the Gønger II and will be broadcast in 1993-94.  The continuation is based - very freely - on Carit Etlar's Captain of the Queen's Guard.
