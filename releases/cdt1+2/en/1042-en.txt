I maintain that film has and must have the same power as literature and art.  But if film is to be taken seriously, you also have to deal with important subjects in film.  This is, mind you, not synonymous with film being boring.  I have taken just as long to create "Lovely Is Earth" as a whole feature film.  Each scene is built on a studio stage in order to get it completely accurate," says the director, who is a perfectionist with respect to composition and statement in each image.

In the fifteen years since "Giliap", he has worked with advertising film.

"Advertising films are honest.  They don't pretend to be something else and, in commercial film, I have experienced greater latitude to experiment with film language than any place else," he says.
