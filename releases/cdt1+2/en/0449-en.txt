That was exactly the way it was not supposed to be understood, but the amazed Danish couple were soon to experience that there was something in the talk.  In a scientific report on the topic, they could read - Heidi could - that coloured lenses had helped many Australian dyslexics.  Not everyone, but most of the research subjects had an easier time with reading training, because the image of the letters became calmer.

Reading training.  Just the words can make André's head tired.  At any rate, if he was supposed to spell his way through.

-  In the 2nd grade, I learned that I was dyslexic and, in the years following, I received loads of special education, and I went at it as best I could.  After the 7th grade, I first spent a year at a boarding school for the dyslexic, then another year at a second.

But it did no good.  André's eyes could not grasp the black figures on the white paper and, when he had finally dragged himself through a line, he could hardly remember how it began.
