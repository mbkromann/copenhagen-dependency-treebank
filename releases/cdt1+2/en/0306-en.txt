BIRTH CONTROL PILLS DURING MENOPAUSE?

Many women want to stop taking birth control pills, when they are in their late 40s.  However, this raises a whole series of questions, which the doctors will answer here - among other things, whether hormones can replace birth control pills.

Bodil is 49 years old.  She has taken birth control pills for many years.  Early on, she had 3 children, one after the other, did not want any more, and, because of her opposition to abortion, wanted to make 100% sure.  Therefore, she chose birth control pills, which have served her well without side effects.

When she turned 40, I spoke with her about a different form of prevention instead of birth control pills, but she did not want it under any circumstances.  Any risks there might be for women over 40, she would take upon her own shoulders.
