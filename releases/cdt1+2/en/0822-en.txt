Since we live in a country where it is a matter of course that we are informed of the expiration date on salami, it cannot be accepted that we do not have far more information about the hospital sector.  The results of the proposed analyses should, therefore, be accessible, so the patient can choose whether he wants to wait until there is space at a hospital with a small margin of error or perhaps accept one where it is greater.

One of the main characters in the case, consulting physician Hans Gregersen, is cited for the following statement:

"There was nothing that told us that the problems were greater than with other hip operations.  It is far from unusual that a leg becomes one-two centimetres shorter.  In fact, it can in some instances be an advantage for the patient, because it is more difficult, then, for the prosthetic hip to become dislocated".

Two questions are raised in this connection.

- If there is a statistical probability on a national basis that it can be an advantage for one leg to be longer or shorter after the operation, I think it could be interesting to know whether people normally aim for the long or the short version.
