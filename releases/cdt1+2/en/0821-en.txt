In many cultures, the sibling relationship is considered more important than that of a couple.  In western European society, it has stepped into the background.  Nevertheless, many siblings - for example, 40 percent in a Swedish study - and especially sisters say that, throughout their entire lives, they have had close contact with each other.  Even in periods where there have been conflicts and where they did not see each other as often, the existence of a sister is a fixed point in their lives.  Objectively, it is the case that sisterhood can last 80-90 years and survive both diverse marriages and parent-children relationships.  Sisters know each other intimately in a way that no one else does.  Indeed, not even parents know their daughters as well as they know each other.  They share many more secrets with each other than parents dream of.

What they have in common

Every woman is like - and is still different from - her sister.  Born from the same parents, they are bound by their common sex, common experiences, intimate familiarity with the same people and the same places.  The smell and sounds of the old family home, memories of parties, vacations, deaths.
