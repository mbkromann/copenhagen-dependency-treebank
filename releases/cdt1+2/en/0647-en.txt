If, over the course of the day, you should catch sight of men with a sallow complexion and noticeable bags under their eyes roaming aimlessly around the city, you should neither be surprised nor frightened.  The men in question are simply film reviewers and quite harmless.

Their wandering, aimless behaviour today is due to the fact that this day is highly unusual for them.  There is not a single premiere in Danish movie theatres and so the film reviewers' existence has momentarily lost its meaning.

Not because reviewers usually sit watching streams of films on Friday.  The kind film companies and movie theatres make sure to introduce new films at special press screenings, as a rule, several days before the premiere, and the reviewers thus have plenty of time to do their work.  If some nonsense should sometimes appear in a film review, it is thus due not to time pressure, even though, of course, it is most convenient for the reviewers if the readers believe that.
