According to Eilif Larsen, the injured football players must get out of bed quickly to begin re-training.

"At the moment, everything is going according to plan, even though there has not yet been time for re-training.  Henrik Andersen still needs to rest, but he is doing considerably better," says Eilif Larsen to B.T.

The telephones have been ringing in the little hospital ward in Br√∏ndby.  Everybody wants to hear how the injured football player is doing.  Henrik Andersen, who had trouble sleeping the first few days, is dead tired. 

"It is not exaggerating, if the telephone rings 50 times an hour.  Henrik has pepped up considerably, and he has rested a bit, since he got a break from the telephone," says Henrik Andersen's little brother Kristian.

GREAT SYMPATHY

The 26-year-old football player spent Thursday evening together with his Belgian wife Fabienne.  Earlier in the day, he had had a small television and a video installed in the hospital ward, so he could see the rest of the semi-final match against Holland.

Among the football players in the physically-demanding EC tournament, there is great professional sympathy for the unfortunate sportsman.
