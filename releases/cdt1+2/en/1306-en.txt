The Queen has twice before during her reign held a ball for a broad cross-section of the world of art.  That was in 1976 and in 1985.  The artists need not fear that, on this occasion, they themselves must provide a number.  The Life Guard will play Tafelmusik, and the Lancers will be danced.  Who is going to play for the dance will preferably be a surprise.

THE PRINCES WILL ATTEND

Crown Prince Frederik and Prince Joachim, who return home this weekend from Malaysia, where they have been on vacation with their father Prince Henrik, will also attend the ball.  Prince Henrik will not return home from Malaysia for a week, where he will be sailing.

Among the many who have the pleasure of the court invitation may be mentioned ballet dancers Alexander KÃ¸lpin and Rose Gad, opera singer Guido Paevatalu and his wife Susanne Rolind, Eva Deichmann of The Danish Royal Theatre, who has worked a great deal with the Queen in connection with the Queen's scenography for "A Folk Tale"; nor has Margrethe in this connection forgotten her colleagues, scenographers Lars Juhl and Jens Jacob Worsaae.
