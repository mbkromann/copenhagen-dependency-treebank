The course, which combines three senses: sight, hearing, and touch, is normally offered at the Typing School in Copenhagen and, here, 24 Danish teachers from high school have been getting lessons since the spring.  Now they are passing on their talents to their students - who are crazy about it.

"When you begin to be proficient, it is just incredibly fun.  It is much easier and quicker to type with ten fingers than with two," says Filip Willemoes.  He is one of "the experts" from the 4th grade, who have already finished the obligatory 25 hours of lessons.

"I thought I'll never be able to learn this.  I almost gave up in advance, but after a week it went better," adds Ulrik Holst Hansen; and Marie Louise LÃ¸vgren sends a grateful thought to "the gas" - the candy that the teachers distributed to keep their spirits up.

There has to be a little room for indulgence, because "you go a little cuckoo in the head" from sitting every morning for two weeks between eight to eleven just typing the same series of letters and numbers.  On the other hand, it is fun to type at home, they all say in concert.
