Two well-known Russian historians, Andronik Mirganjan and Igor Klamkin, do not believe that Russia can be developed without an "iron fist".  They claim that Russia's path to democracy goes through dictatorship.  In one of their articles, it is stated: "In an authoritarian regime, society is stratified and different interests matured.  And when their representatives are ready to go at each others' throats, an iron fist puts a stop to it.  In this way, the conditions are always created for a harmonization of interests and, consequently, for democratic reforms".

And they added: "Precisely because we do not even have a germ of a civil society, we are against the Duma.  Apart from the illusion of democracy, it can provide nothing real.  It could not quite objectively.  This was not at all because of the shackles of the system.  Illusions are dangerous.  They breed disappointment and, ultimately, lead to a destabilization of society, which we have already seen and, unfortunately, will come to see more of."  They believe that the Duma should give the President dictatorial powers.
