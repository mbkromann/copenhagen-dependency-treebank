"People can take several paths now and, in many ways, I feel that we have greater elbow room than people had, for example, in the 1950s," says Jesper Termansen, who has applied to come to the US for a year and learn mathematics.

Then, he wants to study economics or political science and work abroad.

For 20-year-old Jonas Brix, it is a matter of earning some money and experiencing the rest of the world "before it's too late."

"If trends continue, I can imagine that I'll end up becoming one of those people fighting for nature.  I'm not more than 20 years old and I can see the environment is becoming worse and worse," says Jonas.

While he and Trine do not have great faith in centralized international co-operation, for example, through a strengthened EC, Jesper and Tamilla believe that it is the necessary way to go.

But the four agree that their generation, far more than previous generations, will work to improve the environment and the Earth's general state of health.  So, there is still hope.
