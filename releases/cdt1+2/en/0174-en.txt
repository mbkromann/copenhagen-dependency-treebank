When the multinational American record company Warner Brothers wrote a million dollars on the back of their suede jackets a couple of years ago, and their big Danish breakthrough LP "No Fuel Left For The Pilgrims" was to be released all over the world, there was literally no limit to the performances.

But later, they discovered that the million had been linked to doing two records and paying various expenses for promotion.  In the interim, it has only led to a couple of used cars.

"But there is nothing for repairs," says Jesper Binzer.

However, the four have seen the world in the last year.

Wonderful world "No Fuel Left For The Pilgrims" has sold just under half a million copies the world over.  Mostly in Denmark: 100,000 copies, while the rest are distributed nicely around the world with Japan and Australia as the largest purchasers of D.A.D.'s down-to-earth rock.

"We were in the US on the sort of tour, where we ate for three days, played for one, only to eat for three days again and play for one, etc. ? in order to suck up to the radio stations," says Jesper Binzer.
