BUTTONED UP

Winter has been harsh and tough for the Brøndby management's otherwise so well-groomed image.

After Bjerregaard had made a statement that sportswriters are not so good at reading football financial numbers, the daily newspaper Børsen began to tackle the championship club.

Recently, Børsen has dug so deeply into the club finances that it fears for Brøndby's InterBank ruin and for the club's credibility.

Bjerregaard's complicated private speculations in and around Brøndby IF have also been castigated in a less than flattering way.

The age of high finance in Brøndby IF has transformed a once so open football club into a silent, buttoned-up business that suspiciously guards its big banking secrets round-the-clock.

Just as Morten Olsen, before every Super League game, watches over and guards his starting position to the general wonder and irritation of Brøndby's spectator-customers.

CREDIBILITY 

Brøndby has become a closed club that speculates large off the field and small within.

Last week's legally spotless but morally debatable "seizure of power" by Per Pedersen hardly bolsters Brøndby's beleaguered image, but will inevitably increase mistrust of the blue-yellow Super League superpower.
