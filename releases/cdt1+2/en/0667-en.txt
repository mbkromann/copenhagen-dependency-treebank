19-year old Frank Olsen from CIK demonstrated at the Zealand championships at Dansborg Hall in Hvidovre that he has the potential of becoming a prominent figure in Danish boxing.  With aggressive boxing mixed with nice 1-2 combinations, he triumphed over Lars B. Hansen from Kors√∏r with a clear 5-0 in welterweight and then continued the elegant moves he showed in the semi-finals against the experienced Isa Fidan.

"I could tell that I had boxed a hard fight against Fidan.  But I also think that it really went very well today.  I knew that I was faster than him and had control of the fight the whole time," says Frank Olsen.

He also won the Zealand championship last year, but is still a bit short in the resolve to make the effort to get all the way to the top.  Nor did the triumph yesterday get Frank Olsen to announce that people can expect great things from him in the future.
