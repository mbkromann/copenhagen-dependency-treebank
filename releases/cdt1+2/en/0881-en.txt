"So, we haven't achieved all that much, but we got the Word out a bit."

One of those who was visited was Ove Andersen, who however did not take time out for a chat with the two evangelists:

"We had guests and were about to eat, but otherwise I would have invited them in.  Now I myself am a Jehovah's Witness, so they probably can't tell me anything I don't already know," said Ove Andersen, who found it OK that a "competing enterprise" rang the doorbell.

"All Christians should do this to spread the message," he believed.

At 2:00 p.m., some of the town's citizens had found their way to church, where there was a worship service in honour of the day - a sort of demonstration against the ETAHS event.
