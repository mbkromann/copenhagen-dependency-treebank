-  Yes, I was.

-  Would you call it ? love?

Lars didn't respond.  He wanted out.  To get far away.  The room was shrinking.  Now it was serious.  Now it hurt.

-  No, I wouldn't.  why?

-  Because ? well, yeah.  But then you've never been really, seriously in love?

Lars replied that it was hard to say.

Gunnar shook his head, talking to himself:

-  No, he said,  -  you know that for sure, deep inside.  It boils and you're happy and the next moment ?

Gunnar pulled out the top drawer and laid the letter on the table.  Lars mumbled something about it being late.

-  I've rewritten it a thousand times, said Gunnar.  -  It's been lying here for weeks.  I couldn't make myself send it.

He was now looking directly at Lars.  His look was puzzled.  The unhappy angel.  Quite unnecessary, Lars thought, and bloody unfair.
