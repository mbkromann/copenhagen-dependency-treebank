"We know nothing about the terrorists," replies the nationalist party Sinn Fein, but no one believes this.  All the other political parties, without exception, consider Sinn Fein as the political wing of the IRA - the Irish Republican Army, and they do not consider it unlikely that the party's chairman and member of Parliament Gerry Adams is also the head of the IRA.

"We disclaim any responsibility for the murders.  We have no connection with the paramilitary groups," protests Sinn Fein's official spokesman, Richard McCauley.  The words ring hollow in the dirty, pathetic run-down classroom in a community centre of Belfast's Catholic slum, where he holds a press meeting.

If he had instead said that "the others are just as bad", one might have believed him.  For the Protestant terror groups, the Ulster Freedom Fighters and the Ulster Defence Association, which the other day murdered five random Catholics in a bookmaker's shop, are not much better.  Whereas the IRA, according to police information, are "political activists without a criminal past", the Protestant paramilitary organisations consist primarily of "ordinary, callous criminals".
