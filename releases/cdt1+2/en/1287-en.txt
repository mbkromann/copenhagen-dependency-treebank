Speed down

The EC's traffic ministers have decided that all trucks from January 1, 1994, must be equipped with a speed control device, so they can be driven at maximum top speed of 85 km/h.  For the owners of Scania trucks, a conversion to comply with the future legal requirements can be done for around a "thou", as the EDC engines of Scania cars are prepared via electronically-controlled diesel intake.

Cold MC trip

Shinji Kazama, a 41-year old Japanese man, has become the first man to ride a motorcycle to the South Pole.  Earlier, he made the trip to the North Pole - also on a motorcycle.  That was in 1987.  This time, it took Kazama about a month's time to cross the ice cap and reach his polar goal.  He was only delayed a couple of days.  The Japanese man was escorted by a belt-driven snowmobile with food and supplies.  He preferred to ride at night, when the frost made it easier to force the terrain.  He had to have help once on the 2,000 km long trip.
