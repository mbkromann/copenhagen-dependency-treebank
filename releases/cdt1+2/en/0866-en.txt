"We have the right arguments against it and active no-people here, there and everywhere.  And so we are counting on the people having already been thoroughly vaccinated against Uffe Ellemann and Jacques Delors.  Then, the no vote is in the bag", Steen Gade thought.

As far as the domestic political front is concerned, he stressed that "SF is the think tank for the whole of Denmark, when it comes to innovation and change."

And he characterized the KV government as "the most ragtag government in man's memory."

"If the Social Liberal Party, CD and Christian People's Party do not say stop soon to this decline that has occurred in ordinary, decent parliamentary behavior, then these three parties will assume a direct co-responsibility for this decline," Steen Gade maintained.

Holger K. Nielsen thought that the government "was rife with scandals, and any political logic should dictate that it would have keeled over a long time ago."  He believed that the government would be forced to resign in the fall.
