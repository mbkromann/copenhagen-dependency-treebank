And the man is dangerous - also when he disagrees with his director.  Just listen to how Jerzy Skolimowski, director of the film "The Light Ship" (on TV2 on Sunday), characterizes him:

"The guy is rather explosive.  He doesn't possess much talent for coexisting with his fellow human beings."

But Brandauer does have a talent for something.  In fact, this year, he has been married for 26 years to his childhood sweetheart, Karin MÃ¼ller, from the Austrian village of Altaussee.

Klaus Maria Brandauer met his Karin, when she was 18.  She lived at the other end of the village.  The couple's son, Christian, was born a few months after their wedding.

When Brandauer met Karin, he had a dream of a large family with as many children as possible and himself sitting in state at the end of the table.  But Karin had other thoughts.  After having flirted a bit with art and journalism, she applied herself to school in order to end up as a successful television director.  And the love child, Christian, was their only child.
