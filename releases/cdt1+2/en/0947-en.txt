SF's initiative has a tripartite structure, which includes points that SF cannot go along with, what the party can go along with without further ado, and what in SF's opinion must be improved.

Steen Gade says that SF cannot go along with a common defense, the economic-monetary union, union citizenship and parts of the legal cooperation.  There could also be no discussion of any surrender of sovereignty.

But the party would like an EC ombudsman, a consumer policy and, presumably, also an industrial policy, while according to SF improvements must be negotiated at home to procure more democracy, a genuine principle of subsidiarity, better environmental provisions and wage earner rights.

"We must of necessity get started on these three things.  We will ask the other parties to study our paper and hear whether they do not believe that it is on this basis we should begin in loyalty to the no vote in the referendum," says Steen Gade.

The chairman of Parliament's EC committee, Ivar Nørgaard ( S ), has said that a new Danish  agreement with the EC must be able to be approved by SF, but his party fellow, EC spokesperson Bjørn Westh, would not repeat this.
