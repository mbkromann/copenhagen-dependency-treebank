The peace demonstrations, which took place last week many places in Europe with great backing, affect all people in one way or another.  

No one likes missiles, nor do the Central Democrats and other non-socialist-oriented parties in Denmark.

Now, no missiles will be deployed in Denmark, this decision has been taken.  The peace movements (run by the left wing), in which many well-meaning but frightened people participate, can make their demonstrations more credible, if they convince us others that they would write about and demonstrate against the rearmament of the Eastern powers in the same way as they daily try to press Western Europe not to deploy the 572 missiles.  But how can we influence the closed system of an East-block country?

I think it will be difficult for the US and the Soviet Union to come to an agreement in Geneva in a relatively short time.  But I want to emphasise strongly that the people of the West also desire peace, but a peace in freedom and therefore a credible defence (home guard) and support for NATO as far as Denmark is concerned are particularly necessary, given Denmark's location.
