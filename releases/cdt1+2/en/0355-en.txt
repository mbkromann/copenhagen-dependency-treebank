Now he is chuckling, and finally he speaks.


"What do think the pains are, then," he asks, "if not your body's fear of me?"


I say to him that my longing for him is stronger than pain.


Instead of answering, he steps out from the corner and stands beside my bed.  He bends down and kisses me on the neck.  His left hand is laid on my breastbone and, after a while, his fingertips glide down until they rest above my navel.


At that moment, I understand that the pain, which is my body's fear of Death, is stronger than everything, stronger than any longing, than any resolution.  The sky becomes red from its flames; birds flap with smouldering feathers and crash, spiraling toward the earth. 


If I could speak, I would beg for life.  If I could produce a sound, I would scream until someone heard it, until help came, but with a mighty voice, the pain calls me to it, and I am sucked down like a withered leaf in the wind through throat and ribcage into the centre of the whirlwind of fire.
