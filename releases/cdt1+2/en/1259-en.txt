But is it really?  Not necessarily, says assistant professor, Dion Sommer, M. Psych., Institute for Psychology at Aarhus University.  And, at any rate, we cannot measure the quality of childhood in our day by the norms applicable when we ourselves were children.

"Children's circumstances have changed so much in recent years that we really do not have any basis for comparison," he says.

"Our view of what is good for children comes from another time.  In reality, it means that our cultural conceptions of childhood become a sort of straightjacket, a form that does not fit, and where we then cut off the parts that fall outside - instead of using and enjoying the new possibilities.

Our relationship to childhood becomes defensive, characterised by concern and fear.  We assess our own performance by some ideal conceptions, which we do not feel we can live up to.

We always forget to look at the historical perspectives, at the cultural and social changes.
