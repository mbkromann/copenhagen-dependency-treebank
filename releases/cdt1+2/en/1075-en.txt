Minister for Industry Anne Birgitte Lundholt (Cons.) has announced that the accounting legislation must be tightened.  S is aiming to have a resolution ready for the opening of Parliament on October 1, and there are demands for considerable tightening in the melting pot.

"When approximately 40 percent of the population individually have stocks and, to a high degree, employee pension funds put money in public companies, then the ordinary man must be certain that his savings are being properly taken care of," says Erlings Olsen, referring to a series of scandals and lost millions in large publicly-traded Danish companies.  Placement of responsibility "You can no longer say they are isolated instances, and it has been difficult to place responsibility in the individual cases.  Therefore, the rules must be tightened," says the S spokesperson.

S is working to have the following bill made into law or requirements from the Copenhagen Stock Exchange:

New accountant every fifth year.  No one may be an accountant for a publicly-traded company for more than five years, so new eyes can look at it.  Accounting firms will not get away with reshuffling accountants internally in their firm.
