Supplement "In accordance with the Social Assistance Act 56, everyone can, in fact, get a supplement to employ a home helper themselves.  Municipalities must take care of older people in a satisfactory way and, if they cannot manage it, they must pay older people to employ home help themselves," says Bente Munck.

"That is how I read the Social Assistance Act, and I intend to propagate this construction here in Silkeborg.  Unfortunately, it is the municipalities who assess the needs of the elderly - and they apply an economic point of view.  But that is too short-sighted, because when the elderly lack help, they wind up in the hospital.  They cannot come home again, because there is nobody to look after them and the nursing homes are full.

Put harshly, I believe that municipalities have the blame for the elderly winding up in hospitals biding their time at DKK 1,500 a day," she says.
