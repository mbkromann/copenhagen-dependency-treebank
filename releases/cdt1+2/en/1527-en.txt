But now, fortunately, there is such great pressure from the American Embassy and the Danish Foreign Ministry that we will succeed in getting the crew home," says Jan Fabricius.

"What is going to happen to the ship, I don't know.  You can apparently expect anything from the so-called peacekeeping forces in the country.  They are actually holding the crew as hostages.  But I cannot imagine that they can just steal a ship in this way."

The peacekeeping force in Monrovia has accused the ship of transporting weapons - but the Danish owners deny this to be the case.

The Bahamas-registered coaster has for a year and a half shuttled between the Ivory Coast and Liberia's capital, Monrovia.  There are ten crew members on the ship, of whom six are Danish.  In addition, there are a number of passengers, among them, an American and three Malayans.
