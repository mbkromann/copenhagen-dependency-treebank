The once so extensive Kosan group has scattered to the winds.  Yesterday, Kosan Teknova was sold, and remaining in Kosan Holding is only Crisplant.  At the same time, the investment consortium Scandinavian Acquisition Capital has taken over 90 percent of Kosan Holding.

The management in the two Kosan companies will participate in the new ownership structure.  The Crisplant management, among others managing director Mogens Petersen, is taking over 10 percent of the shares in Kosan Holding.  Teknova director Erik Thygesen is subscribing to 24.5 percent of the shares in his own business, while Unibank is taking over the rest, until alternative investors are found.

Kosan Holding has since 1989 been owned by Unibank (at that time, the SDS savings bank) with 70 percent and Kosan directors Mogens Petersen, Erik Thygesen and J. P. Fischer Hansen, each with 10 percent.

Early in 1989, the Tholstrup family put the Kosan Group up for sale and, in April the same year, SDS implemented together with four Kosan directors - the fourth was Robert Storm - the first management buy-out.  At that point in time, the Kosan Group included ten subsidiaries.
