President Yeltsin received a storm of applause, when yesterday he triumphantly declared communism dead and a 75-year nightmare to be ended in a speech to members of Congress.  However, he also warned that there will not be a new chance for Russian democracy.

"The world can breathe a sight of relief.  Communism, which spread conflict, enmity and unheard-of brutality everywhere, has broken down, and it will never rise again.  I will personally guarantee this," he said.

Yeltsin also declared that there will be no more lies, when he guaranteed to the Americans that no stone will be left unturned to find the truth about missing prisoners of war in the Soviet gulag.

With the booming voice that has become his trademark, he assured from the most distinguished speaker's chair in the US that the democratic Russian government cannot be brought down by reactionary forces.

"They cannot overthrow Yeltsin.  I am in good health, and I don't intend to run off before the reforms have been made irreversible."
