"For those who have read Hans Christian Andersen, the stories will never disappear.  It is terrible that the original manuscripts have disappeared.  But the most important thing about his fairytales is that they are told and read," says Victor Borge, who is now recording several of the author's fairytales for a major television program to be broadcast in the US.

"Hans Christian Andersen is world-renowned, because his writings have been translated into every language.  But books are not as popular as entertainment as they once were, and it is difficult to say how many people today know him here in the US.  The younger generation is not so used to this sort of literature.  So, the television program is a campaign to try to popularize him," says Victor Borge for whom Hans Christian Andersen has great significance.
