"The enamel paintings were at the start just a bit of arts and craft, which were supposed to provide some quick money alongside my oil painting.  But I was fascinated by this form of representation, and I cannot describe how excited I still am, when the kiln is opened for the finished result.

During my work, I am for brief moments untouchable.  It is a feeling as electric and strong as falling in love.  These happy moments always take me by surprise.  In fact, when I least think that something can be done.  Then suddenly, maybe after I have bought eight oranges or smoked a cigarette, the line comes, then the next, and the struggle with the painting is commenced, and I must show how strong I am.

The process is characterised by joy and the opposite.  It is this inner dualism that shifts boundaries.  But I never try to repeat a form or anything else in a picture that is successful.  If you try, either because a gallery owner dictates it for business reasons or of one's own free will, the art ends up becoming banal.
