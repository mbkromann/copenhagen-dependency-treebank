-  I'm terribly sorry about it, I say to the man beneath the trailer.  -  I hope nothing has happened.


-  Why is it called Scraggly? asks the man.  -  No one would think of calling such a thing Scraggly.


Even though I can only see the man's nose, I become technically interested in the problem.


-  Don't you think Scraggly is a very nice name? I ask.  -  It is my husband who thought of it.


-  Get it OUT OF MY CANOE! he says.


-  Shoot it! suggests a child from a thicket.


Scraggly weighs around 250 kg.  She is a little difficult to get out of the canoe.  Especially when she has no harness or collar or whatever else it is may be in which she is usually clad, when she airs her charms outside, but we are finally able to haul her out by the ears.  The canoe looks intact and nice, if a bit messy.  The two smallest dusty children come out of a red hawthorn and pet Scraggly.
