Chapter I


How does a child move within language?


Where is the child I once was

is it still in me or gone?

Pablo Neruda, 1978


An infant can do more than its parents know.  Or rather, more than they might contemplate, because what the infant can do is only something it shows, not something it says.  What a child can do more than what people really notice is something that is very difficult.  But we have all been able to do it.  Fortunately, we only have to be able to do it the one time: learn to know the world as it looks to people in the region, where we are born.  At the same time that we learn to know the world, we learn our first language.  So, we can gradually also be told something more about it.  Now, as a practical matter, all normal infants are inclined to learn the language that those around them speak.  It is naturally a relief that none of the children in Valby begin by speaking Finnish, which is so difficult.
