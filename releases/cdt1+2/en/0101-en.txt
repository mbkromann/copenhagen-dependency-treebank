Later in the day, there was a team time trial and, here, Ariostea triumphed with a victory of 41.23 minutes for 36.5 km.  In second place came Castorama with Laurent Fignon and Bjarne Riis at 41.31.  Then followed Panasonic, PDM, Clas, Buckler and, surprisingly, only as no. seven "Z" with Lemond.

The next were Motorola, Gatorade-Chateau d'Ax, Banesto and Amaya with Per Pedersen.

It was even thought that TVM with Jesper Skibby could achieve a top placement, by which Skibby would come far up in the overall position, but the team had bad luck and never found its rhythm.

Many had bad luck.  Alcala had a flat tire after five kilometres and Greg Lemond had a flat tire after only 10 metres.

THE BITTER CRASH

The Ariostea crew got a report that they were leading in the team race.  That made the riders go too far beyond their abilities in the last curve approximately 700 metres from the goal.  Here, Rolf SÃ¸rensen's back wheel slipped, and he crashed, pulling both Moreno Argentin and Cassani with him.
