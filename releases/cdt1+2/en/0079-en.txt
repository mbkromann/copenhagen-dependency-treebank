"My father has stuck his peepee up into me," reported a retarded girl via a message board, and it resulted in a police report against the innocent parents.  The parents were convicted but had to go through a gruelling case.

The report, which has cost 800,000, was ordered and paid by the Copenhagen County Council after an intense debate on the extent to which the message board was a con or a valuable means to communicate with so-called "severely physically and psychically handicapped".

WITH A GUIDED HAND

The use of message boards began at the M-house in Copenhagen County's hospital department for the multiple-handicapped, Vangedehuse, and gradually spread to other institutions.  The County estimates that up towards 100 handicapped people have used or use the message boards.

The handicapped, who do not speak, sit together with two or more tutors facing the message board, which consists of the alphabet and a few other symbols.  In order to provide support, a tutor guides the handicapped's hand over the message board, until the client points to a symbol on the board.
