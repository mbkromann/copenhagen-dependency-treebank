The case aroused great attention, when the grandmother and children, the first time they were on the run together, were arrested in a major police action at Djursland.  Present at the arrest were employees of the Municipality of Søllerød.  An anonymous source had told the social authorities where they were hiding.

But the week after, the grandmother and her attorney once again removed the children from the Bagsværd Assessment Center, and they have since been well hidden.

While the grandmother hid, she together with her attorney, Holger Lindholt, Copenhagen, succeeded in having parental rights transferred to her in a decision by the Copenhagen Prefect's Office.

VICTORY FOR ALL GRANDMOTHERS

Inge Daugaard's attorney, Holger Lindholt: "This decision is simply a victory for all Denmark's grandmothers.  It shows that you can easily take care of your grandchildren, even though you are up in years.  It is a matter of love alone.  The two children love their grandmother more than anything in the world.  And I can guarantee that she can handle it.  She is a woman with fortitude and warmth you only rarely meet.  The children will have a good upbringing with her.
