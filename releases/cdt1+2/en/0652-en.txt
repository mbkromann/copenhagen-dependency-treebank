Lademann's Big Encyclopaedia contains around 100,000 headwords divided into just under 8,000 pages - of which 40 percent are illustrations.  The Big Danish Encyclopaedia at just under DKK 15,000 comes in containing approximately 200,000 headwords divided into 12,000 pages - of which approximately 20 percent are illustrations.

The quantity of text in Gyldendal's encyclopaedia is, according to Gyldendal itself, almost three times as large as in Lademann's lexicon - among other things, because one average page in the encyclopaedia will contain a quantity of text corresponding to three-four so-called normal pages.

JÃ¸rn Lund, editor in chief for the Big Danish Encyclopaedia, comments:

"With our lexicon, we are addressing the highly educated academic as well as the general public.  We would not be able to live with creating high-brow lexicon.  We want people to be wiser from reading the encyclopaedia and, therefore, the articles will be both competent and comprehensible.  You have to remember that it is not always the case that the most prevalent lexicon is also the best."
