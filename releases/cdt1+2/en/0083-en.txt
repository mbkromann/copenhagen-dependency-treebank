I have not seen a larger selection of shoes in this special style outside of Paris and London, where lovely ladies have already crawled up onto platforms in the winter cold.

Sarah-longlegs-Koch is showing '60s for B.T. today, and I guarantee that the shoe style as long as the unique stocks are available can be found in sizes 36 to 41 - or, at least, to size 40. Beautiful 

The clothes, which could also certainly make some people wild in the warmth, if it comes, are from the same store, where like lacquer headbands in a variety of colors cost DKK 49.  The psychedelic patterned cloche DKK 149 and Marilyn Monroe bathing suit in colored Lycra with photographs of Marilyn on the behind DKK 299 - which is also the price for many of the store's other bathing suits.

Big sellers

Worn Levi's jeans to lace booties from when mother was young cost DKK 399 - the booties DKK 499.  Suede shoes with narrow straps cost DKK 499.  So do red suede shoes with ankle straps, as do op-art lacquer in black with white heels.  But you can save a couple of hundred on other big seller shoe styles at Eddie's.
