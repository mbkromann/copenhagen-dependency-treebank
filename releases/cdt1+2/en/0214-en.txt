In the subsequent 10 years, around DKK 800 million have been given to individual projects and research institutes.  The numbers from 1972-82 are estimated on the basis of Sheila Jasanoff "Technological Innovation in a Corporate State: The Case of Biotechnology in the Federal Republic of Germany", Research Policy 14, 1985, pp. 23-38.  In recent years, DKK 600-1,000 million have been appropriated annually in England, West Germany and France for support programmes.
