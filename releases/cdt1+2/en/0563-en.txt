"Do you live at home?" asked the journalist.

Liv nodded, trying to free herself.

"We have clear proof that the man fires young people when they turn 18."

The young people distributed pamphlets and signatures from earlier employees who uniformly spoke about Petersen's peculiar terms of employment.  The discussion blazed up again, and Liv used the occasion to pop into the store.  

"Well done Liv," shouted Julie after her.

"Now you'll get into Ekstrabladet.  Maybe you'll get an offer from Copenhagen Models," giggled Marianne, looking a bit envious.

She had already started pouring the batter onto the plate and completely forgot to tell Liv that Peter had invited them to go to Tivoli.

"Did you see his cool boat?"  She pressed the waffle iron together with a movement that made the excess batter squirt out over her red-checked apron.
