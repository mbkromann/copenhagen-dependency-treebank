We are hungry and are refused by all the restaurants.  On a side street, a fa√ßade is blinking in green neon.  Here, we can get something to eat, but we must pay to get in.  The bar is dark and oblong and full of businessmen.  Beautiful, painted women in tight dresses circulate along the row of suited men.  It is definitely a hooker bar.  The walls are typically decorated with Coca Cola ads and mirrors.  I remember a travel story that, in Czechoslovakia, you could buy a hooker for a piece of soap.  A story that tells about the poverty that even today is the reality for many.

I look for a long time at a beautiful hooker with dark hair and a soft, round body.  I would like to lather her in soap, but I catch sight of the two big doormen and know that they will get every cent I have.  We drink gin and juice and disappear in a taxi to the first bar.
