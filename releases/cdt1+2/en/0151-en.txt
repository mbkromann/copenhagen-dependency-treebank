Two crowd magnets, which - each in their own way - portray modern Paris.  French cocktail Place Clichy is a beautiful and decorative square.  It could be the background scenery for any French film - detective movie, psychological thriller or steamy love movie.

Outside of France, the square may be best known from Henry Miller's juicy novel "Quiet Days in Clichy", where he tells about his bohemian life among whores and pimps - and artists of every sort - in the hectic and chaotic 1930s.

For Parisians, Place Clichy, however, represents something more.

Bars, restaurants, cinemas, theatres, thriving business - and then, of course, girls of easy virtue - create a cocktail that cannot be more French and which one can hardly find better anywhere in Paris.

An exciting evening in Paris' nightlife can to great advantage be introduced with a dinner at one of Place Clichy's many excellent restaurants.

Spicy dumplings in the soup?

You get them, if you continue down Boulevard de Clichy towards Place Pigalle and Place Blanche, where no-nonsense nightclubs and striptease shows run non-stop through the night and offer something for every taste.
