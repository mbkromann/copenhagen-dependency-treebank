In most studies, student admissions are divided into two quotas.  In quota I, applicants are assessed by their grade average, and here the deadline for application expires on 1 July 1992.

In quota II, the applicants' individual qualifications are assessed - for example, residence abroad or at a high school.  And in quota II, the deadline for application expires on 15 March 1992.

"If you are seeking a place in quota II, it is a very good idea to contact the educational institutions.  For they themselves determine what they will stress for their applicants.  And the more you know, the better chance you have," says the Deputy Head of the Administration and Services Secretariat, Merethe Markvard.

All applicants will receive a response no later than 28 July 1992.
