This has not changed, so it will be no easy task to convince the skeptics that Denmark is not on its way into a union," says Karen Siune, a Ph.D. in political science, Århus University.

Yet, she is convinced that the yes-parties have a fair chance of doing the job, so that a majority of Danes will vote yes to the special agreement in the spring.

"The special agreement appears to accommodate pretty much the whole national compromise, and it can especially take the sting out of the opposition that we now say no to union citizenship," Karen Siune believes.

Together with two colleagues from Århus University, she mapped out who voted no on June 2 - and why.  The investigation revealed that Danes harbored an enormous disinclination toward precisely union citizenship.


A problem of explanation 

Both Karen Siune and associate professor Lars Bille from Copenhagen University stress that the yes-parties may have an explanation problem, if they are going to sell the special agreement as a whole new basis for the referendum.
