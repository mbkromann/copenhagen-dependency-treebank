Carbohydrates, which are absorbed slowly in the body provide a good and lasting sense of satiety.

Good carbohydrates are found in bread, grains, pasta, rice, potatoes, vegetables and fruit.  They should be a part of every meal - and for between-meal snacks, they may be the only component.

Milk and butter

Fatty acids are divided into saturated, polysaturated and monosaturated types.  They must also be included as equal parts of a diet.  Most Danes eat too many saturated fatty acids, which are found in dairy products and meat products.

Polysaturated fatty acids are contained in corn, grape seed and sunflower oil and in low-fat margarine.  Monosaturated fatty acids are found, first and foremost, in olive oil and is also in the fatty acid eaten most in the south, where they do not experience as many heart vessel diseases.

Fish and fowl

Protein is found primarily in protein, fish and fowl.  There is a tendency for us here at home to get too much protein from the wrong sources.  This is due to our all too great consumption of beef and pork.
