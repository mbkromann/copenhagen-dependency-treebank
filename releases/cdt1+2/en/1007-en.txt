In the coming years, it should be easier to raise the quality level of our institutions of higher learning.  A desire that industry apparently shares with a number of students.

A broad majority in Parliament went along in June with a compromise for a new statute.  It goes a long way toward fulfilling Danish Industry's desires for strengthening the leadership structure at institutions of higher learning.  The law promotes a clear placement of responsibility and the self-government that there needs to be to create innovation.

It is a law that contains possibilities.  They must be exploited, when the law becomes effective after the new year.  First and foremost to increase the quality of the teaching and research.  Increased quality is the road to greater employment opportunities in industry for those who have completed their education.  It is quality that makes Danish industry competitive.  It is a clear consequence of the new statute that it has now been left to the individual educational institutions to set entry requirements and to ensure an ever higher level throughout the entire course of education.  It is a development that industry welcomes.  This also means, naturally, that it is no longer possible to educate more and more for the same means.
