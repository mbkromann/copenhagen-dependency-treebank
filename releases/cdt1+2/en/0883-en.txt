The underground hospital is worth a visit.  Jersey was, along with the other Channel Islands, occupied during the Second World War.  Here, Russian prisoners of war, among others, dug a tunnel facility through the rocks.  It was never finished, but a nearly kilometer-long tunnel was completed.

At first, among other things, the tunnels were used as an artillery depot.  But later, an underground hospital was fitted out there.  It was never used.  Now you can see how it looked, when the German withdrew.  The rest is a large exhibition about the Second World War on Jersey.

On the whole, Jersey is teeming with museums: the bunker museum, the motor museum, the museum of steam engines, the military museum and the recently-renovated Jersey museum, just to mention a few.

Never have I seen so much history about an area the size of Sams√∏, where as many people live as in Randers and where only half of them are Jersey residents.

The island's newest tourist attraction really gets the history balloon to rise up into the air.  For eight million pounds, "Living Legend" was built, where you are guided through the entire history with pictures, sound, fog, lightning, thunder, storms and other effects.
