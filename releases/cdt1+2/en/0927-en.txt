This global consciousness has since had significant influence on almost everything that Kim Fupz has touched.  Around 1980, he discovered his ability for political/satirical drawing, and when the Rhythmic Evening School of Copenhagen even wanted to pay for his drawings, the future stood luminously clear.  Since then, he has supplied a long series of drawings with his familiar mischievous non-streak to newspapers and magazines such as Ugeavisen KÃ¸benhavn, Politisk Revy, Journalisten and Det Fri Aktuelt.

In the mid-'80s, he acquired a taste for writing himself.  In the last eight years, he has among other things written and drawn taboo-breaking comic book series such as "Far Out of the Throat" and "Get Up, Stand Up" and the popular children's books "The World's Ugliest Girl", "Big and Strong" and the hilarious "The Time My Uncle Kulle Went Crazy".  He also received the Ministry of Culture's children's book prize for 1990.

For the past five years, Kim Fupz has lived in the relatively nice "silver anniversary quarter" of Christiania, together with his small daughter Sally and his girlfriend Ulla, who as a 20-year resident of Christiania is among the free city's founders.
