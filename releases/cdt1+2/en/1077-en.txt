But the argument is entirely clear, the state must preserve cultural values, there must be jogging paths, exercise paths, orienteering races, horse trails, public access in general, and private hunters cannot control that - but here it is entirely clear that, in private forests and areas, there are no problems with and between public access and private hunters, and all the game statistics clearly show that hunting can only be improved by private hunters looking after the hunt.  More game, better feeding, better wildlife and care of nature.

If, for example, you look at Southern Zealand, where the most area by far is privately leased for hunting, there is far more game but, at the same time, hunting also has a more natural relationship to the local population, as people are used to seeing hunters, more wild game is eaten and they get thereby greater pleasure from nature.  In Northern Zealand, on the other hand, it is the state's people who, discreetly during the weekdays, when others are working, go hunting, the wildlife is sold to the advantage of the state coffers to a select few, and people are alienated for the most natural thing of all - hunting.
