We are far too busy.  Because most people go through the day without breaks.  Off to school, work, sports or play.  Out shopping.  Only at the dinner table do people have a chance to be together.

Therefore, it is worthwhile to make something out of the dining space in the house, so you have a cosier time here.

There is a tendency no longer to be satisfied with a little corner in the kitchen.  People have a dining room or, at least, a nice place in a quiet part of the living room.

Don't we all know places where people will gladly sit at the table for a long time and just not want to get into a good armchair?  It has something to do with both the chairs and the table - and the space around it.  Go together.

It is important that table and chairs go together, not simply in appearance, but also in measurement.  It is not healthy to sit with lifted shoulders in order to reach the food or bent down at a low table.
