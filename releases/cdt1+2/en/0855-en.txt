I have personally, several times at that, seen JÃ¸rgen Clevin use red cardboard that way, when he sawed a carton of non-fat milk in half.  The height of dangerous indoctrination was reached on January 12, 1976, when Clevin before the eyes of half a million minors said:

-  And now we're going to use the hammer to fix the sail.

Did you catch that?  Read the sentence one more time.  Hammer and seal, excuse me?  And Clevin is still carrying on his socially-harmful activity.

Now it's not that I want to sound ungrateful.

It must have really been tough for Jacobsen to sit all those years in front of the tape recorder, and it cannot be denied that, at times, the man has been affected by the many hours of watching the tape roll. 

By God, he has not followed the path of least resistance, but has lost everything, right from his Open Waters Forecast to his Fishing Report.

Therefore, we have a lot to thank Erhard and ALS for.

At random, the great suspicion of public school teachers in the 70s' must be mentioned.  Excellent work.  Ten percent indoctrinate, claimed Erhard frankly.
