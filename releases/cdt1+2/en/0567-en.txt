There is going to be some crap shooting with the household money.  For Mrs Kirsten always needs a little more money for cooking


ARNE DOESN'T HAVE IT

-  Sometimes, I get over-stressed, and an appointment might slip, says the extremely busy traffic minister.  SÃ¸sser can sign off on that


The first time, I was invited for a chopped steak at Traffic Minister Arne Melchior's luxury flat at Israel's Square in Copenhagen.  Both the photographer and I were looking forward to it very much.  We saw to it that we were there on time.  For it is an unwritten law that ministers always keep their appointments.  But, alas, Arne Melchior had forgotten everything about the dinner.  
-  This is terrible - terrible.  It will never happen again.  You must come next Thursday.  I promise you will get a chopped steak you will never forget.

The next Thursday, we were just as punctual.  We were standing in our best outfits, ringing the doorbell.  And it actually looked as if we caught the minister in bed.  - What's going on, are you coming today?  You really have to forgive me, but I have completely forgotten our appointment.  This is really horrible.
