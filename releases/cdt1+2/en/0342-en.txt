No trace is to be seen of the brisk autumn of earlier times.  The only mitigating circumstance in favour of the wind is that the dust spares me the sight of the gloomy landscape.


In the interest of truth, I must add another and just as important mitigating factor, namely, the benefit that, in the impenetrable dusty world I find myself in the middle of, there is actually also a cheering thought based on the knowledge that the wind is also drying out the swamp, making it stone hard and encrusted.  The earth is ground into a fine red dust, which the wind moves around at its pleasure.  


This fact is the most important thing for me, if I am to say anything positive about the absurd weather, because the marsh croakers cannot, as they usually do, come rushing up out of their starting holes like earth to earth missiles.  


In this respect, I can breathe a sigh of relief and let my tension disappear with the wind and give my wounds time to heal, while my enemies are made sluggish and dry out in their brood pouches.
