According to the government, it is a matter of 3,800 tonnes of toxic waste that were brought to Koko between August 1987 and May of this year.

It was brought into Nigeria on false documents via Koko's little harbour.

Now it stands stacked up in front of Nana's house.  The barrels are standing unprotected from weather and wind.  Some of them are leaking, and there are a few places where a sticky mass has run out onto the ground.  An unpleasant chemical smell has spread, but Nana and those of his 24 children who still live at home say that they have gotten used to it.

Nana confirms that, last year in September, he entered into an agreement with an Italian, Giancarlo Raffaelli, and a Nigerian businessman to store the toxic barrels for 500 naira (DKK 650) a month.

After the revelation of the toxic waste, Nigeria has detained two ships, made various arrests and threatened to execute the guilty parties.

Danish ship

One of the detained ships is the Danish coaster "Danix" from the Phoenix shipping company in Esbjerg.  "Danix" is in the harbour town of Port-Harcourt, and the crew on board has had their passports confiscated.
