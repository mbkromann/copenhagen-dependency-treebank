In 1972, Skjern got its first pub.

It was called the Office Bodega, and it was not a place you let yourself be seen, if you wanted to be popular with the city's dominant Inner Mission circle.

That was the same year that Poul-Erik Billeskov came to town.

"But there is no organic connection between these two things," he stresses.

20 years later, Inner Mission lost the parish council election in Skjern.

For the first time in 100 years.

And this time, Poul-Erik Billeskov cannot deny having had a finger in the game.

He was a candidate for - and an initiator of the Grundtvigian-Social Democratic collaboration that won the majority in Skjern's parish council.

At eight-five it stood in the old days.  That was until this week's parish council election.  Now it stands at seven-six.  And that is not in favour of the pious.
