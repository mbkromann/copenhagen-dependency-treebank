"We gauge the emergency calls once a week.  Last Monday, 27 percent of 1,000 calls went through 0-0-0.  The number has been consistently between 23-28 percent since 1 May.  So, it cannot be said there has been progress for the new number," says Bjarne Rylander, director of the Network and Traffic Section of KTAS.  The many reports of the greatly increasing frequency of wrong numbers to emergency control centers has made KTAS think about commencing a new information campaign.

"It sounds likely that emergency control centers are registering a greater frequency of wrong numbers than before.  A combination of numbers provides a greater risk - and this indicates that we need to resume the campaign.  At the same time, we do not want to close down 0-0-0 yet.  We do not want to bear the blame in any accidents," says head of public relations at KTAS, Benny Dam.

He adds that KTAS "is not yet so skilled" that it can technically sort out everyone who, for example, want to call a number with the starting digits 31 12 -
