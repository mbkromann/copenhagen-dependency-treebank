As the driven minority government it is, the ministry Poul Schl√ºter IV has just proposed a finance bill that continues the moderate economic policy of recent years - but without provocative or ideological savings proposals that might in advance push the crucial non-socialist centre parties over into the arms of the Social Democrats.

Nevertheless, the debate on Denmark's economic policy is once again about to become a question of ideology or morality, if you will.  For with carefully organised precision, the Social Democrats came out the same day - Tuesday - with their alternative "finance bill".  The ideological/moral differences are clear and may crudely be expressed in this way:

The Social Democrats: We cannot very well let the unemployed foot the bill.  We have such a large surplus in the balance of payments that we can afford to grease the wheels of Danish commerce.  We'll take the chance now.  With financial relief (larger public deficit), private consumption will rise markedly.  Then, unemployment will fall and tax revenue will increase.  The title of the plan: "The Virtuous Circle".
