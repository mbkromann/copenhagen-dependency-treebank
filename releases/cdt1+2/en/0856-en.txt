Where the importer has a responsibility to make sure that his grapes have not first taken a trip through the gas chamber.

A significant portion of the grapes that are imported to Denmark come to Copenhagen.

And at the wholesale vegetable market in Valby as well a wholesaler off the marketplace, the Municipal Food Safety Unit in Copenhagen has since April uncovered ten attempts to sell a total of 20 tonnes of sulphur-treated grapes to Danish consumers. 

Most of the firms involved must now take a trip to court, where it will be demanded that they be given hefty fines for gambling with the people's health.

The "busted" grapes come from South Africa, Chile and Brazil - but the problem is not limited to these countries.  The Danish health authorities have also in recent years uncovered gassed grapes from European producer countries - but, here, the grape season does not begin until later in the year.
