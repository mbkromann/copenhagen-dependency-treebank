Valter sat in the little garret, as he called his room, wondering whether he should go to bed or sneak down to the pub, when there was a knock at the door.  It was his hostess.

-  Telephone for you, she said churlishly.  He went in with her and glared at her, until with an audible sniff she went out to the kitchen.  Then he picked up the receiver.

-  Valter Johnsen.

-  Yes, it's me.

-  Oh, is it you?  Valter laughed cannily.  -  What do you want?

-  We have to meet tonight.  I have to talk to you.

-  OK, where?

-  At the railway bridge, you know.  At the corner of the woods.

-  That's sure a strange place to meet.
