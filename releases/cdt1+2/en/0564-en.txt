Something about blackouts and ration coupons and the lack of southern fruits.  People of that generation prefer mumbling to clear speech and they would rather see that nothing is said at all.  Especially not about their so-called private life, which in their view is threatened by being exposed to direct light or will straight out disappear."

Lotte wanted to know how much older Søren was than Peter.

"A hundred years, you can probably hear."

"Søren was born the year before the occupation and I was born the year after.  Those seven years in this exceptional case constitute a whole generation.  Discussion is not the same thing as devaluation.  And Lotte does not run around gossiping, I'm sure."

"Ih, I'm looking forward to a wee glass," Lykke piped in.  "There's nothing like a wee glass to focus the mind and lift it up to higher planes."
