ODENSE: They are both fathers, 31 years old and with the beginnings of a tendency toward a receding hair line.

But they are also a couple of playful kids, football fans and cut-ups.

And they are also two of Odense Theatre's most talented actors.  Now they're going to play Tvebak and Jonathan in a dramatisation of Astrid Lindgren's fairytale "The Brothers Lionheart".

Kim Harris and Henrik Prip are slaving away these days to rediscover their inner child.  They have been instructed to ransack their memory and try to remember how they were when they were children.

And if memory fails, they can help prod each other a bit.

"Yes, because we have known each other since we were eight - ten years old," says Kim Harris.

"At that time, we were on the same football team at the Vedb√¶k Football Club.  We spent many years together on that team," says Henrik Prip.

FIRST CIGARETTES 

"That was when we smoked our first cigarettes together," remembers Kim, puffing on his pipe - you grow up, after all.
