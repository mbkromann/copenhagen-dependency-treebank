The proposal for joint group meetings between V and K is not entirely new.

In fact, a historic joint group meeting was held before the launching of the KV plan in 1964, and, in 1965, it cost the leader of the Liberal Party at that time, former Prime Minister Erik Erikson his role as the party's leading figure that he directly supported a merger of the two parties.

The time was not ripe then for such a decisive step:

"Nor is it, for that matter, now.  We must first, at any rate, go through a long, long period during which people in the two parties can become acquainted with each other's chemistry.  Here, regular joint group and executive committee meetings could be a step along the way.

This would prevent many misunderstandings between our two parties.

We must think of the co-operation among the coming generation of non-socialist politicians.  It would be a shame for the whole thing to fall through, because some individuals have kept the co-operation going," says the Minister for Fisheries.

After a weekend with his family at Fan√∏, he was in Brussels on Monday at the EC Minister of Fisheries meeting.
