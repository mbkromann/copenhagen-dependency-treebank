Family outbreaks most common

Most infections come from unprocessed raw ingredients contaminating prepared dishes.  

Therefore, most cases are so-called family outbreaks, whereas infections from institutional kitchens are rarer.

Institutional kitchens are subject to health inspection, and there are requirements for the design and equipment of the kitchens and the education of the personnel.


Infection often runs its course mildly

A salmonella infection runs its course mildly in the vast majority of people.  Diarrhea is the most common symptom, some also have a slight fever in the beginning.  The discomfort most often lasts only a few days.

"In very rare instances, the salmonella bacteria can enter into the blood and cause blood poisoning, and then the condition can become serious.  This is particularly true at hospitals and nursing homes, where the patients and residents are already in a weakened state.  Some die of the infection," says Knud Gaarslev.

"There are no proper statistics on how many die," says Hedda Bille, the National Health Service.


Older people especially are hit

This is because it is older people especially who are affected and, in many cases, they have other illnesses.
