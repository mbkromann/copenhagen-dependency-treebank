On Saturday, the Danes will be reminded that it is good to see Danish films in the cinemas.

The Danish Film Institute turned 20 years old on October 1 and will mark the occasion on Saturday with a film festival, in which 75 selected films - of the 240, which the institute has supported over the years in all - will be shown in 130 of the country's 160 cinemas.

You will be able to purchase two tickets for the price of one and, in a number of Bilka and OBS stores, where Danish film trailers are being shown these days on large video screens, a film quiz will be organized with free tickets to Danish films as premiums.

"We would like to heighten our profile and show that the Danish Film Institute is not a boring institution," says institute director Bo Christensen.  "It is no secret that the market share of Danish films has been falling in recent years and is now rumbling down at 10-11 percent.  With the film festival, which we are organizing with good co-operation from the film industry, we hope to change this situation."
