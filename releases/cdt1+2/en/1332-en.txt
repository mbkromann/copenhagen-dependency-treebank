The Poles started out hard and harassed our players more than they care for.

But the switch in goalkeepers changed the storyline completely.

The reserve Onyszko was "cold" and had not made himself felt, when Jacob Kjeldberg and Jens Madsen in shifts demonstrated what you can achieve with persistent training in free kick.

Two of the dead ball situations, which are rarely profitable, resulted in a couple of beautiful goals, when with a well-developed kicking technique they fired the ball past the wall, challenging Onyszko.

He could not handle them.

It seemed as if he had oiled his hands in soft soap.

He could not hold on to the ball, and so Miklos Molnar and Peter MÃ¸ller with their sense of being right where the so-called loose chances are saw to it that the ball was pushed over the line.

PROBLEMS

The Poles scored no goal, but they played so quickly, inventively individually and collectively, that it cannot be precluded that a Danish team in the same position may have problems in a return match.
