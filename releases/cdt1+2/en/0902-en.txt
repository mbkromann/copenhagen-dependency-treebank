Cut the zucchini and cucumber in half lengthwise.  Scrape out the core of the cucumber, but not the zucchini.  Cut the zucchini and cucumber in small pieces crosswise.  Halve the egg plants and cut through the halves lengthwise and in pieces crosswise.  Blend them in a bowl.  Rinse pepper and cut the shell into small pieces but not too small.

Cut the onion into small pieces and warm the oil and butter well in a wide-bottom frying pan.  Put in the onions and stir.  Sauté them until they have gotten a little colour.  Then stir the mixture of zucchini, cucumber and eggplant into the onions and sauté the mixture over a high heat for a few minutes.  Stir in the peppers and again sauté for a couple of minutes.  Add salt and pepper to taste.  Scrape the mixture into an oven-proof dish, approximately 22 cm x 30 cm.  Place the dish in the oven and roast the mixture at the same time as the meat.  The vegetables must have 35-40 minutes.  Pour on 1/2-3/4 dl fat and liquid from the meat, when the meat has roasted for 20 minutes.  Move the dish with the vegetables up in the oven at the same time as the meat.
