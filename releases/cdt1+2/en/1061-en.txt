They also suggest cutting back on the time for national service to approximately one month, at the same time that, in the short run (up to 1996), there will be new investment in equipment for approximately 5 billion crowns.

The reduction must necessarily occur in the Jutland Division, whose purpose, on the whole, has disappeared along with the threat of war from the East.  It was the Jutland Division that, along with the north German NATO forces, were to be put into the defence of Schleswig against the advancing DDR tanks.  Now the DDR equipment are part of the German NATO army, and even though there continues to be a large number of Russian soldiers stationed in former East Germany, the threat from there is assessed as hypothetical.

The remains of the Jutland Division will become a part of NATO's Main Defence Forces, it is said in the report.  And to a lesser degree in the new Reaction Forces in NATO, which will particularly be used in connection with international "crisis management".

New challenges

While the highest officials in the armed forces thus continue to operate with a large national defence, the experts in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs emphasise in the very same report that security problems today lie a completely different place.
