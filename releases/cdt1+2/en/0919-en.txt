The traffic stops completely.  Cars are covered with large Danish flags.  An immigrant family in their old car have turned on the windshield wipers - there are Danish flags tied to each wiper.

The buses cannot get across the square and now people are beginning to crawl up on them.  A Line 6 is packed like a bus at rush hour - but all the passengers are standing on top of the bus.  The driver is completely alone, he runs around the bus like a confused beetle in a matchbox.  A short time later, two uniformed officers arrive, ordering people to come down and escorting the bus across the square.

Down on Str√∏get, the party continues.

And in Jorck's Passage, Copenhagen gets the carnival that flared up the other day.  Here, a whole samba orchestra is playing.

On top of the newspaper kiosk in the passage, there is a roligan with a clap hat.  He swings the large street lamp to and fro and directs.

At the Stork Fountain, national sentiment has overflowed and a gathered crowd is singing the national anthem.  The end sounds almost like "sailing up the creek".  And then we do.  The rest of the night.
