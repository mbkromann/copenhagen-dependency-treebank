BEGAN WITH THE BEATLES

"Realistically, it is a minor part of my career - the time will be mostly used on my own concerts and records, but the others will get all the publicity (laughter).  Apart from that, I don't play with people because they're famous, but because I love their music."

And Lofgren is very honoured at playing with Ringo, who for years played - some would say, tried to play - drums with those four guys from Liverpool.

"It was the Beatles who got me started in rock music, and I still think today that the Beatles' total production is the best music ever made," says Nils Lofgren.  That may well be, but nevertheless it is all too overlooked that Nils Lofgren solo makes some excellent rock records.  A new and excellent example - "Crooked Line" - has just come out.  Down-to-earth rock and roll, the good old fashioned way - not unlike John Mellancamp's "Whenever We Wanted" from last year.
