As in all the other forms of etiquette, a particular worldview is expressed in the politically correct use of language, and PC language is used consciously as a spearhead to change the view of the existing world order.

A marriage, for example, is called in PC: home imprisonment, legalised rape or legalised prostitution.  Just as a wife is designated as an unpaid sex worker or survivor of home imprisonment.  In other words: it's not so nice to go along.

Alimony is called repayment or compensation, because the emphasis is on the receiver being morally entitled to receive the money.  A housewife is a domestic-artist, a home-ecologist or unpaid labour.  To be white is bad - PI for politically incorrect - but to be a white man is one of the worst things you can be.  According to the politically correct handbook and dictionary, there can be no discussion as to whether a white man in a racist, sexist class society is an oppressor, because he is.  By definition.
