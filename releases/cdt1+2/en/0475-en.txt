Soon no more jokes and sarcastic remarks can be written about the former Filipino presidential first lady Imelda Marcos' 1,500 pairs of shoes, which have been displayed in a special museum in the Malacanang Palace in Manila.

The shoes have been removed, and there are strong rumours that Imelda Marcos has gotten them back.

The museum in Malacanang, a sort of cabinet of horror that is supposed to describe the bizarre and extravagant lifestyle of the late president Ferdinand Marcos and his wife, when they were in power in the 1960s and '70s, has now been taken over by the country's Cultural Foundation and is to display, instead, what the Philippine nation has mastered culturally through the years.

Amelito Ramos, wife of the current president Fidel Ramos, said the other day at the opening of the revamped museum, "that here the nation will demonstrate that we are not only a country that produces cheap domestic help and guest workers".

Coming exhibitions will, among other things, deal with Philippine art through the ages.
