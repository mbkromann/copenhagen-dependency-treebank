But common to the over 2,000 periodicals that are entered into the database under discussion is the fact that they operate with a system of so-called referees.  It is a highly refined system in which the periodical editor uses specialists - referees - to assess the manuscripts submitted.  Each manuscript is sent to at least one scholar who is himself active and recognised in the relevant area of research.  He evaluates whether the manuscript says anything at all of interest, whether the topic is important - and whether the results are.  In a periodical such as Nature or Science, only articles are accepted with important news about important topics.  A referee will also look at whether a manuscript presents its results in a satisfactory way.  A referee then recommends whether the article should be printed or not, perhaps with some changes.  In this refined system, it is utterly crucial that a referee is anonymous, so a colleague can "slaughter" a manuscript without fearing after-effects.
