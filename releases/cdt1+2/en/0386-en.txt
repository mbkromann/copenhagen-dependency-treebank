Snow will forever remind me of last year's Christmas outing.

My girlfriend and I had decided that we would go to Copenhagen with our four children, so they could see the radiance of the big city ?

Unfortunately, we happened to tell the children about our plans far in advance, so that when the day came there was no possibility for retreat.  And it even turned out that a fierce snowfall the night before had made the roads and railways impassable.  We noted this immediately at the station in the provincial town where we live.  The train to Copenhagen was delayed approximately 45 minutes ?

In TÃ¥strup, the train could not go further on account of frozen switches, so we had to get off and walk for quite a way.

"Let's grab a taxi," I shouted to my girlfriend in the driving snow, but my at that time seven-year old offspring answered immediately: "Shouldn't we grab a hotdog instead?"

We reached with some delay the much-coveted department stores, where the children suggested that we head for the cafeterias ?
