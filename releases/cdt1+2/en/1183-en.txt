Danes' consumption of over-the-counter pain-relievers is so alarmingly great that, for many, it is pure abuse, believes medical officer Niels Agdal, Randers.

The consumption of pharmaceuticals such as Kodimagnyl, Treo, Panodil and Pamol is now so great that it corresponds to every Dane taking 160 pills annually over his/her lifetime.

"By now, people are taking pain-relievers like lemon drops or some kind of diet supplement.  This is concerning, because over-the-counter medicine is not harmless," says Niels Agdal, making reference to the fact that the number of deaths from salicylic acid poisoning rose from 5 in 1980 to 23 in 1989.  Around half of these cases were suicide.

Danes consume annually approximately 400 tons of active substances - Acetylsalicylic acid or Paracetamol -  "and this quantity must be taken as a sign of abuse," says Niels Agdal.

On an ordinary Friday in September, he asked five pharmacies in Randers with 65,000 inhabitants to record the total number of sales of pain-relievers.  31,632 tablets were sold - and several pharmacies declared that, on that day, they sold an usually small amount of painkillers.
