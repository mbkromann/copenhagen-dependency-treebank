Thomas Stuer had to yield a set against the Korean Lee Kwan-Jin, but in the quarter final against the Chinese Wan Shengwen: "I won 15-9, 15-8, but was far behind in both sets, respectively, 0-7 and 2-7, before I got my basic game in place.  Especially in the first set, I varied my game well."

The most recent two times, Thomas Stuer has won the 1st set against Ardy Wiranata and, before today's semi-final, the tactics are: "Ardy must be kept back with a solid basic game, like I have put into practice in the 1st set, but both times have lost my grip on in the 2nd set, because I had the wind behind me.  Here in Japan, there is a side wind, and I have an easier time controlling for that."

The Danish women's and men's doubles took place yesterday, but in the mix three of the four semi-final pairs are Danish, so we are assured a place in the finals, when Henrik Svarrer/Marlene Thomsen meet our normally best constellation of Thomas Lund/Pernille Dupont.
