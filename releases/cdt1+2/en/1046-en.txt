UN sources say that an airport building has been destroyed.  The area around the Holiday Inn hotel in the Bosnian capital has also been bombarded with mortars by the warring parties, who have increased the pressure on each other up to the international peace conference on Yugoslavia, which is to take place in London on Wednesday.

The Serbian-dominated news bureau Tanjug has earlier reported that around 1,700 artillery shells have landed in Serbian-dominated areas within the last twenty-four hours.

Around 20 soldiers and civilians were killed during the bombardment, said Tanjug, but the numbers have not yet been confirmed.

UN debate Bosnia-Herzegovina received yesterday a stream of support and sympathy from the UN General Assembly, where Islamic countries encouraged the use of military power to help the beleaguered republic.

"The debate must sent a clear message to those who are responsible for the mutilation of Bosnia-Herzegovina that the patience of international community has run out and that further acts of violence and violations of international norms will not be permitted," said Turkey's UN ambassador, Mustafa Aksin.
