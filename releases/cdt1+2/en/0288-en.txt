To an orgy at Søren's

The whole thing started with my girlfriend and I were supposed to go to party at Søren's, one of my girlfriend's classmates.

First, I said no, but Tina continued to pressure me.  There would be a lot of people coming we knew, so - OK with me.

We went into town to find some smart clothes.  We went into Coctail, Odense's smartest fashion boutique.  There we found some super-tight thigh-short skirts in black and a pink sun top.  Then, we bought a bottle of gin-lime, which we took home.  We made ourselves look luscious and ordered a taxi for 9:00 p.m.

At that point, we had drunk the gin and we were, in fact, half-drunk, when the taxi arrived.

When we got out to Søren's, a number of guests had arrived, but it was only boys.
