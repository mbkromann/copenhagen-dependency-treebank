We are not used to the calm, I am trying to communicate.  Look at the newscasters on television.  They can't even get the smile off their lips between the funny news and the dead children in Somalia, it has to go so fast.  That's not the way it is in life.  All people experience happiness and tragedy, but most of life is taken up by things that happen again and again, as they do in the film, walks, summers, an uncle who sings the same song every time there is party and gets everybody to laugh.  Life goes on and, finally, it ends, and you can stand and smile, as Karen-Lise Mynster does so wonderfully.  When the heart is breaking.

She can smile, because she has profited by learning from the past.  She has loved her son with all the love she was not allowed to give a man, and she has only him, but she sets him free.  Her heart is breaking, when he says that he wants to get away from Jewish clannishness, but she pushes him out the door herself and waves after him.
