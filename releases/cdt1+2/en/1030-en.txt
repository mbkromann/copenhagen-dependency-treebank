I would venture to say that the shift from Altan's slightly introverted music to the Scottish Wolffstone's was quite palpable: maybe, like coming from a field of grass in misty weather and directly out onto a highway in a fire storm.  An electric music that was bursting with physical energy, but also well-structured with reminiscences of both Run Rig and the Irish group Moving Hearts, particularly in the way Frits Morrison entered into the interplay with the three guitarists.  And connoisseurs of the Scottish bagpipe (not without reason called war pipes) will not be surprised that, in terms of volume, he was able to hold its own with the guitarists. Singer Ivan Drever also stressed the line to Moving Hearts with his clear influence from Christy Moore (whom we have yet to hear on a Danish stage).

Thus, the music drew its multi-coloured rainbow geographically as well as stylistically in a great span across the British island empire and to the rainy marshland in the most fascinating multiplicity.  My soul, what more do you want?  The TÃ¸nder Festival, Saturday.
