However, it is interesting that all combatants have come to the realisation that the political and administrative structure in the public sector has significance for local development and progress.  The next step could be an acceptance of the fact that the problems in the region of the capital are special in relationship to Ærøskøbing and Sindal.  Or in other words, that it could be appropriate to adapt the division of tasks and burdens of the public sector in the region of the capital directed in accordance with this area's challenges and less in accordance with the view that the same terms and conditions must also apply to Ærøskøbing.

It is absolutely necessary for there to be a discussion on the governance of the capital region, but at the moment, the contributions have been dominated almost to the point of insufferability by a lack of inventiveness and will for innovation.  The challenge cannot be mistaken. A model must be found for structuring the public sector that can constitute a school for municipal reform, which may also light the candle in other areas of the country, where there is a political will and ability to take new paths to promote development.  Even if it must mean change.
