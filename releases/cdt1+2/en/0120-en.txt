The Norwegian girls lost with the same numbers on Saturday against the WC host nation.

"We are in the WC's absolute best group, a real dynamite pool," says the 29-year old mid-court player Susan Mackensie, Hjortshøj/Egå, to B.T.

"The China match was an experience, none of us will ever forget.

The 24,000 spectators alone were something quite extraordinary.  What a sound stage.

A rush went through them every time the ball came down to our half of the court.  The fantastic atmosphere helped motivate us.

And the Chinese audience must be commended.

They were incredibly fair, also backed our opponents and acknowledged our performance."

THE CHINESE SHAKEN

The Danish team was in a good frame of mind before the match.  The girls went onto the court with a devil-may-care optimism.

"We shook the World Championship favourite with tactically-clever, disciplined play.  With will and courage, calm and forethought.  We kept on the ball and made combinations for several chances.  Keld's scheme was followed 100 percent," stressed Susan Mackensie.
