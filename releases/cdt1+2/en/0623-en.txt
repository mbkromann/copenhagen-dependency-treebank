Kitt does not regret that she went through with the rough pregnancy.  She had felt a small life kicking in her stomach and could do nothing else.  But she will absolutely not recommend to others in the same situation to do as she has.

-  No, I would not advise others to do this, because it is very difficult and utterly depletes all your energy.  Another time, I will trust the doctors' advice more.  But they have promised us that it only happens once.  And I hope so, because we would like to have one, maybe, two children.  And preferably soon.

Bent and Kitt Christiansen look at each other.  Deeply and intensely.  A look that reflects love, joy and sorrow.  And hope that before too long they will become parents with a vigorous, little fellow, who will not slip from their grasp like Marc.


-  It can only go so wrong once, say the doctors.  And what can I do other than hope, says 23-year old Kitt, who was only able to be a mother for an hour.
