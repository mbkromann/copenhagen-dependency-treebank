Consciousness must be accelerated "After an evening like last night I don't really know what I'm supposed to do - I'm just sitting there like a bird."

It is the next day, and a Stockhausen in an evident splendid mood over the outcome of yesterday's premiere - and apparently well aware himself that he is visually living up to his reputation as the eagle of the European compositional music duck pond - has turned on all his great charm for the group of itinerant Danish music students, who have followed the previous week's rehearsals of "Dienstag".  As the composer also kindly but resolutely refuses to explain much less interpret anything - "it doesn't mean anything to me if there is something people don't understand.  If the program notes aren't enough for them, then they'll just have to invent something."  On the other hand, he speaks happily and with an intensity that could fill a much larger space than the Gulbenkian Museum's rehearsal space on compositional technique in the work, particularly in "Oktophonie"
