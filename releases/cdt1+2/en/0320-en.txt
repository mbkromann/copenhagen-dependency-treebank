-  Are you going in to visit Magnild from Chatline, asks Birthe.


-  He has an incredibly sexy voice, Maja adds.


-  Yes, and a heated pool and a Volvo.  Sonja's eyes brighten at the thought.


-  It's probably for a disabled driver, just like the last one, laughs Sally, taking out her cigarettes.  -  Anyway, I have to look out for my bizniz.


She opens her cigarette case.  There are four butts plus a whole Camel.


-  You never have anything but bizniz in your head.  Maja momentarily lifts her gaze.  - 75 øre a piece, says Sally, looking out into the air.


-  75 øre.  Man, you're rough.  You don't pay an øre for them.  Sonja is deeply offended.


Birthe already has a butt between her lips.


-  Okay, bulk discount.  Take one each.  Give me 2 crowns altogether.


-  With matches? asks Sonja.


-  Of course, says Sally.  -  and the whole Camel doesn't cost extra.  She gestures largely with her hand.
