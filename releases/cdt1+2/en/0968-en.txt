The current shift in attitude is not because there is a new government, but, to the contrary, because the old one, which to this point has professed communism, has shifted course.  In October 1991, the Premier Hun Sen, together with the leaders of the three other political movements in Cambodia, signed a declaration of peace and intent to transform Cambodia from a developing country, plagued by civil war, to a Western-inspired democracy with a market economy as the driving force.

The motivation for signing was not difficult to find.  The signature of the political leaders was a condition for the UN to set into motion the most comprehensive aid operation to date in the organisation's history.  22,000 UN workers will during the course of this year be sent to Cambodia to guide the country to free elections in the spring of 1993.  At the same time, economic development aid will stream into the country.  The bill for the UN operation is expected to exceed DKK 13 billion.  Cautious 

While the many crowns in aid have led to an invasion of Asian businessmen, who have done a quick and profitable business, Western firms have been more cautious in their investments, says the leader of Ã˜K's transport division in Cambodia, Torben Hasselriis.
