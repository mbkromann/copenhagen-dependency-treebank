-  Strange, he mumbled.  -  I have played with Vagga all afternoon.  I have patted him and petted him.  But I have not become sick from it - not this time.  No shortness of breath and no coughing.  Maybe, I'm just not allergic any more?  Maybe, it is gone, like Doctor Berg said:  - He'll grow out of it.

He finally crawled into bed and lay for a long time thinking about the strange thing that had happened to him over the course of the day.

-  No allergy, he whispered.  -  Maybe, never again.  I am eight years old now.  I will soon be big.  Big and strong and no longer some little weakling who gets sick from nothing.

He heard a dog barking out in the twilight.

-  Vagga, he mumbled.  -  It is Vagga calling me.  It wants to play again or it wants some more pâté.

Voices in the house - his father's and mother's voices - grew once again loud and angry.
