But there was a minister instruction that the cases were not to be dealt with.  More Tamils would be prevented from coming into the country," explained Police Commissioner Dahlfelt, who spoke subject to criminal liability.

Among those who participated in the immigration meetings were then Permanent Secretary Poul Lundbæk Andersen and Deputy Director Claus Tornøe, as well as Director Frederik Schydt for the Immigration Office.

"At the meeting in May, Lundbæk said that he had discussed the case with the minister, who had said that there was political backing and support deep within the Social Democratic Party.  Lundbæk seemed a little shaken.  He had at repeated meetings said that he would discuss the case with the minister again."

Police Commissioner Dahlfelt, on the other hand, could not support Deputy Director Claus 
Tornøe's explanation that the halt on the Tamil cases from September 1987 was connected to a plan to send home forcibly just under 3,000 Tamil refugees who had been in Denmark for less than two years - a plan that Ninn-Hansen, according to Tornøe, was supposed to have ordered to be put into motion.
