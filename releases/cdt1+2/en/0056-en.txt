The massacre continued for the next 20 minutes.  Tanks drove in and out between frightened and panicked people in flight.

"I tried to speak to a soldier, saying: Let us decide this in a peaceful manner," said an injured Lithuanian, Atansa Stokus.  As a reply, he was attacked by the soldier, who hit him in the face with a rifle butt.

A colleague at the TV and radio station watched the massacre, shocked, from a window in the TV studio.

"They're driving over people with their tanks.  They're pummeling women," said Eduardas Potashinskas.

Another eyewitness:

"They started shooting at everybody ? no matter if it was women, children or men."

Two members of a Spanish TV crew were beaten by Soviet soldiers, because they had filmed a wounded Lithuanian, who had been helped away from the battlefield. 

Afterward, their camera was confiscated.

A shaken journalist from the Lithuanian newspaper Respublica related that, after the massacre, the Soviet soldiers had tried to dress dead civilian victims in military clothing in order to make them to look like dead soldiers.
