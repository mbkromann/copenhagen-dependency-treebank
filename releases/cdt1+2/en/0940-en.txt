History shows this uncertainty about Denmark's direction.  Unfortunately, we Danes have a record in choosing wrong.  In the last two hundred years, we have done it at least three times - a couple of times with catastrophe as a result - and one time that was leading up to one that was nevertheless prevented, without the Danish people having any influence whatsoever.

The first of two other times I am thinking of was in the period 1800-1814, when we chose the side of the dictator Napoleon - and, subsequently, had Copenhagen bombarded, lost our fleet and Norway, and went into national bankruptcy.

The second time was in 1864, when we thought that we could oppose Bismarck and were unwilling to listen to the other great powers' advice on a negotiated solution - and ,subsequently, lost both Southern and Northern Schleswig.

The third time was in the parliamentary election of 1943 with shadows on the spring of 1945 in Jalta, where we just barely got on the list of free, democratic nations.
