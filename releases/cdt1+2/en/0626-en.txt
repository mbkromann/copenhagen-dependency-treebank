For a long time, they were again silent, and the distant humming of cars from the highway in the white quarter, the bitter struggle of two flies over the remains of the grits on an unlicked spoon, and father's wheezing respiration resounded in Mewa's ears.

-  Mewa needs to go, said father then, keeping his gaze carefully fixed on the spot in the ceiling where the corrugated zinc sheet was bound to the crossbeam with rusty steel wire.

-  Yes, Mewa needs to go.

Mewa heard the beating of her heart blend with the other sounds, felt the pulse at the tips of her fingers, and saw how her father had great difficulty swallowing something or other.  He looked at Elias, who had set up his empty beer cans for the daily car race on the rough concrete floor, at mother, who with her legs spread, one hand on top of her stomach and the other hanging loosely off the armrest, slowly shook her head.  Katie was still sitting on his lap with one hand on the table edge and the other around his shoulder.  She looked at him inquisitively.
