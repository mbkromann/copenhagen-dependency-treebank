The television reported that at least 500 bodies were found in the ruins of Erzincan about 575 km east of Ankara.

It is still not possible to provide a more precise number of the victims, because many villages have been cut off from the outside world, since the earthquake hit.

In some dramatic footage on Turkish television's coverage of the tragedy, a journalist, moving through the ruins in Erzincan, shouted for survivors. 

A voice cried back that there were 20 survivors waiting to be rescued.

Another piece of footage showed a father crying.  "Oh, my children," he cried.

60 students were buried under a collapsed medical faculty building in the centre of the city.

The Anatolian new bureau reported that 517 people had been injured and 251 of them had been hospitalized.

Television showed a long row of buildings in Erzincan that had collapsed.  Ambulance sirens wailed in the background.

The governor of the Erzincan province, Fikret Cuhadaroglu, stated that a quarter of the city lay in ruins.
