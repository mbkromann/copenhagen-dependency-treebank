The big question is what Poul Nyrup Rasmussen is going to do with himself until Supreme Court Judge Mogens Hornslet's report on the Tamil case is made public at the beginning of the new year.  He could, of course, plunge into homespun philosophical considerations on morality and politics, but he could also choose to take his role as opposition leader seriously.  For example, by occupying himself exhaustively with the so called fee case, which at one and the same time is a matter of great principle and very down to earth.  A matter of principle, because it deals with the lack of respect of the Ministry of Justice and the police for the Constitution.  Down to earth, because the fee case has revealed conditions in the Ministry of Justice which cannot go on very much longer.

As a man who has no reluctance in dealing with non-socialist Denmark, Nyrup Rasmussen could start by reading what the periodical BÃ¸rsen itself maintained in a lead article the other day: "that Minister for Justice Hans Engell (C) has apparently completely lost his grip on his own ministry" - and "that it has now gone so far that only a major shift of top officials can re-establish confidence in the Ministry of Justice".
