The letter officially authorised Crescent to "discuss and negotiate" a possible purchase within the joint venture agreement and "to discuss ? the terms and conditions for the procurement of the Iraqi raw oil over the long term."

Hamid Jafar was very eager to show his appreciation of the agreement to his Iraqi partners.  Shortly before the invasion, he ordered an engraved, Swiss, gold pistol assessed at 7,000 pounds from Asprey's, which is the English Queen's jeweller in London.  The purpose was to show the pistol to Saddam Hussein's cousin and son-in-law, Hussein Kamal al Majid, who was once Iraq's Minister for Industry.  When hostilities began, it did not get outside of Baghdad's airport.

Beyond Petrofina, Crescent investigated quite a few other possible targets that the joint venture alliance could acquire, both in North America and Europe.

Hamid Jafar is 45 years old, educated in London, and son of a former Iraqi government minister.  He has lived many years in Sharjeh and received a passport to the United Arab Emirates in 1986, which grants him national affiliation in both Iraq and the United Arab Emirates.
