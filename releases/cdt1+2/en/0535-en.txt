The year 1716-1717 was a tremendous year for Vivaldi here a total of 3 new opuses appeared.  Then, there was once again a pause during which Vivaldi traveled out in the world.  Opus VII was heard by the public for the first time in 1720, then there was a break of 5 years until VIVALDI's greatest success The Four Seasons comes.  The Four Seasons belongs to opus  VIII, which is called "Il Cimento dell'Armonia e dell'Invenzione".  They were actually meant to be four different concertos but were quickly gathered together.  Amsterdam and Paris were the first to have a concert with TFS, which was at the end of 1725.


THE FOUR SEASONS:

( la primavera ) spring written in E-major * 3all

( L'estate ) summer g-minor

( l'autunno ) autumn F-major

( L'inverno ) winter f-minor * 12all Allegro = Quickly lively.


The mood is totally clear Vivaldi is incredible at expressing himself with his music.  Compare the two Works.

Vivaldi has also written many operas and, in 1927, 4 new operas are published.  Maybe play a number.  (14)
