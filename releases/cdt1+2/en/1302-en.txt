When she asked him to put down the knife, he said that he could never think of doing anything to her.  But when she nevertheless tried to take the knife from him, something clicked in him.  THE KNIFE BROKE

"Tonight, there will three who will die," he said and went amok with the knife, which broke during the many hard blows.

"I wanted to scare her," explained the 19-year old at the preliminary hearing.  But the police are in no doubt that it was an attempted homicide.  Again and again, the young man slashed and cut his girlfriend.

"It is a pure accident that he did not kill her," believes Detective Inspector Chr. Petersen.
