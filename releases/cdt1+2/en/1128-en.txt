So slays 42-year old Frits Hansen - lawyer, head of section in the Finance Department, on three-month' leave from his job, incurable alcoholic. 

No, you must not believe everything he says - to the others and to himself.  For with the way he is introduced in Bent William Rasmussen's novel "There Is a Man Lying on a Bench", it is so-so with freedom.  To the dogs

He is well on his way toward going to the dogs because of his drinking - professionally, socially, financially.  In the middle of it all, he gets a notice from the department that his leave will be permanent - his dependence on the wet stuff has made him lose his position.  And even though drinkers as opposed to most others - people are executioners and pigs! - are peaceful people, this truth is not the whole truth, either:

"We have said goodbye to the world and have gone into our own dreams, where it could be wonderful and it could be a hell."
