Eight political parties.  Either winners and eight losers.

That is how the result could be calculated at Christiansborg, after the government had entered into two agreements on the activation of the unemployed with the other parties.  All parties have put their fingerprints on the agreements, all parties have made concessions.

At the last moment, SF was also able to come on board, after being decoupled along with the Social Democratic Party on Wednesday.  Then CD, KrF and the Social Liberal Party proposed a joint draft compromise together with the KV government.

SF has received two small concessions, namely, that leave for the parents of small children and people who want to do continuing education will be raised to 36 weeks.

In addition, SF is "not obligated," as it is put, to support a proposal on private urban renewal.

The proposal is supported by the Social Democratic Party, which did not avoid protests at a group meeting, when the agreement was supposed to be approved yesterday.

"We are complying with the government's wishes without getting anything for it.  It is deeply humiliating," thought Kaj Poulsen.

Jens Risgaard Knudsen said:

"I am extremely nervous about what it contains.  It will probably end up with me going against the whole kit and caboodle.  I have never seen such a political mess."
