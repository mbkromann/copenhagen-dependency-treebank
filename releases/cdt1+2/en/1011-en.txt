The message in "Medicine Man" is big and inescapable - it is about the annihilation of the rain forests and the suicide of the globe.  But a muddled script that wanders down elaborate and lengthy detours and direction that would rather tell a love story that is totally predictable takes the force from the message and gives us instead a hollow melodrama composed of equal parts of hate, hanky-panky, banter and the ultimate melting of hearts.

Sean Connery plays the role of a solitary, mastermind researcher, who in his distant and primitive laboratory some place deep inside the rain forest happens on the trail of substances that can cure cancer.  He is silent and grim, a man with unhappy love affairs behind him, full of professional pride and a becoming self-contempt.  Then his new assistant arrives and, of course, the assistant is a girl - she, too, is a brilliant researcher, and so they argue about and discuss the new discovery, since, of course, there is time for excursions into the breathtakingly beautiful landscape.  It is shown with a rugged pride by him and it is experienced with sighs and self-consciousness by her.
