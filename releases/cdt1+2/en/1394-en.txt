Five hundred metres from home, Munni was hit from behind by a passenger car driven by a 30-year old woman motorist.  The 15-year old girl was riding perfectly correctly along the white stripe of the road's right edge.

Nevertheless, the 30-year old woman from the area drove her Toyota Carina head on into the cyclist, who was slung against the windshield and killed on the spot.

INATTENTIVE

The female motorist could not straight away provide the police with any precise explanation of how she could have overlooked the girl biking on the completely straight stretch of road.  But she admits that, at the moment that the accident occurred, she had her attention focussed towards a garden on her left.  The garden is well-known in the area for its very beautiful landscaping and the lilies are now in full bloom.

Seconds before the collision, Munni had been overtaken by the school principal at Central School, who casually remarked that they needed to pick up their speed a bit in order to get there before the bell at the school yard rang.
