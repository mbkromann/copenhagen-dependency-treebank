On the sidelines of the Skandia drama is Baltica.  Managing director Peter Christoffersen says that there are neither negotiations nor explorations between Baltica and Skandia at the moment.  Skandia once desired a marriage with Baltica. 

Peter Christoffersen will not deny that negotiations will begin again on another front, namely, between Baltica and Hafnia on the large shareholdings that Hafnia has in Baltica.

Just before Christmas, an agreement was entered into between Hafnia and Baltica on selling the large shareholdings, but Hafnia would not accept Skandia as purchaser of a quarter of the Baltica shares.  So the deal fell through.

"And we don't have any other purchasers," says Peter Christoffersen, who nevertheless adds that they have not been out to "scan" the market.

Director Henrik Kl√¶bel, Hafnia Holding, on the other hand, sees no great problems in the fact that Hafnia-Baltica negotiations did not reach a conclusion before Christmas.

He estimates that Hafnia can get even more for the Baltica shares by selling them abroad.  A sale that will be considerably above the exchange rate of around 730 for the Baltica Holding shares.
