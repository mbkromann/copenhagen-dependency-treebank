"You sleep soundly in the morning, but the noise woke me, and I could suddenly hear that it was creaking up above," says Ib Oustrup to B.T.

With lightning speed, he leapt out of bed and went up to the second floor, where the family's four boys from the ages of seven to 17 were asleep.

"I shouted to the children, and when I got up there, the oldest was already awake, and I got all the children down to the living room safe and sound," says Ib Oustrup to B.T.

The flames broke out around 5:30 Sunday morning in their house on Møn, and the children's mother, Annette Laigaard, who is head of social services for Møn, at first had to take shelter with the neighbours, while Ib Oustrup once again went up on the second floor.

"I tried to save what I could of valuable papers and the like, but had to give up," says Ib Oustrup, who received second degree burns on his shoulders and face.

"Instead, we had to stand and watch the flames rage through the second floor, until the fire department reached us after just under 20 minutes.
