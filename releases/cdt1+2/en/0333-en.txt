They kept shoving pills into me and I became more distant.  The next day, there was a thick membrane between me and my surroundings.  They constantly misunderstood me.  Let me give you an example:


The head nurse comes in.  I had being lying there, getting off on a raunchy dream and was pretty horny.  She comes in and straightens my pillow.


"Sweetie," I said with a little emphasis on the T.  "Sweetie, what do I do with my proteins if I get the urge to fire one off?"


"Yes, well, we have a little machine here in the wall," she said, taking a little plastic case.


I didn't really understand.


"You just put it in your ear and lovely music comes out."  "In MY EAR," I said, "but sweetie - at my age! - I can't even get it into my mouth any more, do you think I'm an acrobat?"  "Oh nonsense," she said "we've had patients at the age of 90 have been able to get it in their ear without any difficulty."
