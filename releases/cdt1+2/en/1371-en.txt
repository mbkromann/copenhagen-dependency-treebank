The good Gillan, who is one of the truest gentlemen you could meet, would also like to take on the tough job with the rock clubs one more time to convince people that his role in rock 'n' roll is far from played out.  

"It took me seven years to get things on an even keel, after I left Deep Purple the first time in 1973.  It won't take so long this time, but the band and I must have time to find our musical stance," says Ian Gillan.

"It is fine to play the small clubs, because you don't have the opportunity to hide behind electronics and taped music.  And then there is one more vital reason that I play in the clubs at the moment: it would look stupid to play at Wembley Stadium with 600 paying spectators," grins Gillan.

THE BAND'S APPRENTICESHIP

He considers the last two years as the band's "apprenticeship" and both "Naked Thunder" and "Toolbox" as records made to find their right style.
