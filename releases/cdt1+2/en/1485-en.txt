They had developed a new theory in the Ministry of Propaganda to the effect that the best time for big announcements was at the end of the workday.  In that way, the news was received together in a comradely spirit: there was no opportunity for personal scepticism or defeatism.  The announcements were always timed in such a way that the workers could go home a bit earlier - at ten minutes to five, instead of five o'clock - which promoted a sense of contentment that subconsciously linked the government to good feelings.  That is the way it was in those days.  The snow-white propaganda palace in Wilhelmstrasse employed more psychologists than journalists.

THE PERSONNEL at Werderscher Markt swarmed into the canteen, officers and clerks and typing ladies and drivers, shoulder to shoulder, in an embodiment of the National Socialist ideal.  The four TV screens, one in each corner, showed a map of the Reich, superimposed with a swastika, to the accompaniment of a selection of Beethoven.  Now and then, a male speaker broke in, completely overwrought: "People of Germany!  Prepare yourselves for an important announcement!"  In the old days on the radio, you only got the music.  Progress once again.
