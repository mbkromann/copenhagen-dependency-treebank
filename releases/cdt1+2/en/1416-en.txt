ODENSE: Not until next week is it expected that TV 2 will announce who the new super-boss at Kvægtorvet is to be.

And this appointment may mean that the director to this point Jørgen Schleimann, 63, may leave before time.

The chairman of the board for TV 2, Professor Jørn Henrik Petersen, does not deny that the new boss may assume his responsibilities before Schleimann's contract runs out in October.

"It depends on the person whether there will be an overlap in the period or what," says the chairman of the board.

The normal thing in business in this sort of situation is, when a new boss takes his position, the old one leaves - regardless of whether his contract goes longer.  This may also happen in Schleimann's case, but not necessarily.

PIQUANT PROBLEM 

A slightly piquant problem in the same connection is what Schleimann's secretary, his live-in partner, Annie Gertz's position will be.

The TV 2 board was assembled yesterday and, even though everyone is very secretive, it is now believed that Jørn Henrik Petersen and the rest of the appointments committee have been authorised to enter into a contract with a particular person.
