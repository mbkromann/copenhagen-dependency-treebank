Double life

-  I lived in Aalborg on weekdays.  Acted like the nice girl.  Told only a very few people what I did on the weekend.  On Friday evening, I took the plane.  When I got into it, I was still the nice girl.  When I got out, I had transformed into a vamp.  A femme fatale at whom all the men sent admiring looks.  I was two people, and it became more difficult to shift identity in this way.  

A high-class whore is many things.  They stick to the most expensive hotels and bars.  They make eye contact with a reasonably good-looking and distinguished guy and, after a while, they go over and offer to buy him a drink.

- As a rule, the guy knows that it's a whore they are dealing with.  But most married men - for example, on a business trip - have a better conscience, if they go to bed with a whore and pay for it than if they find some random girl.
