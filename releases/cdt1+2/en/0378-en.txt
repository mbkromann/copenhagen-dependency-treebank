Bonn (Politiken) - The upcoming exchange of spies between East and West, which is believed to include the Soviet-Jewish dissident Anatoly Sharansky, may take place earlier in an attempt to avoid press surveillance.

The West German news bureau DPA reported yesterday that the exchange may take place today instead of, as planned, on Tuesday.  The bureau quotes a well-informed, unnamed source in Bonn as saying that "they are more interested in a successful exchange than a successful media show".

In the biting cold and snow, around a hundred photographers and journalists from a great many countries have for several days veritably occupied the Glienicke bridge in West Berlin's south-western corner.  On the threshold of East Germany, the large press contingent is prepared for an uncertain wait for the major exchange of spies between East and West.

Even on Tuesday, the press began to stream in after the first reports that the Glienicke bridge over the Havel River was once again to form the backdrop for a human trade between the superpowers.
