-  I'll show you the way.  Susanne walked ahead to a small bedroom.  -  Put her there in my bed, she mumbled shyly.

Bjørn did what she said and then they stood across from each other.  For a moment, neither of them knew what they should say.

His thoughts were already with the injured person in Paris, while Susanne's thoughts were unnervingly present.

I ? oh God, I love you, it flew agonizingly through her mind.  I want nothing more than to be your wife and a mother to your little daughter.  Stay here, my love!  The woman who is lying in the hospital in Paris is not worthy of your love.
