The actors have tried ten intercourse positions, and it is clear that the positions provide widely different stimulation and possibilities.  The video film and the book's (too few) scanning images have been equipped with construction lines, so the uninitiated can follow the tempest of organs.  Both film and book are also illustrated with drawings that further clarify the positions and their anatomical consequences.

A number of traditional theories are confirmed: It is, for example, clear how the bladder in certain positions acts as an effective cushion between penis and foetus.  When the woman is sitting "reverse" on the man, among other things.


The G-spot

Lasse Hessel himself also stresses a couple of surprising observations.  Such as, the vagina's walls - except upper walls - are entirely passive during intercourse.  In addition, there is a tendency for better stimulation of the G-spot, if the woman has given birth: In the more relaxed vagina, the penis hits the forewall close to the bottom of the bladder, where the incredibly sensitive G-spot is located, while a penis in a tighter vagina is forced into the vicinity of the uterine neck, where there are no particularly sensitive zones.
