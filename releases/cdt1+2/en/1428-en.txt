Can you be seduced in the King's Garden in 35 degree heat, while you are lying under a shady tree - fully clothed, mind you - drinking bottled water, smoking cigarettes and bending an ear to the confessions of a pop-provocateur?

Yes!

Carsten Bo is - for the record - 33 years old.  He is the son of former Minister for Industry Erling Jensen, a poet, pop singer and author.  The lead in groups with cryptic names, such as 40 Degree Fever, Men in Blue or, more recently, Sea Bee & The D'Generation.  He has - much against his will - been called the '90s' Steffen Brandt or C.V. JÃ¸rgensen.  But that makes him pretty mad.

"I am me!" he insists beneath the several hundred year old oak tree, lying, like the popster he is, on his back in his orange jeans, t-shirt - which naturally reveals a tanned hairy chest - a pair of 1968 "make love not war" sunglasses he has just bought in Paris and a Kings in his mouth.
