County Council Chairperson Per Kaalund would now like to have the suspension of payments thoroughly investigated.

"The question is whether the suspension of payments has put some creditors in a better position than others," he says.

Per Kaalund says that the county was a preferential lender, because the county's loan was to fall due first.

"If the suspension of payments means that the bank consortium, which has loans due in the summer of 1993, is placed on equal footing with the county, then the banks have improved their position, while the county's has been worsened," he says.

To this, bank director Peter Straarup says: "Copenhagen County's supposition that the county is a preferential borrower is totally groundless."

The Ministry of the Interior has asked the county for a satisfactory account of the loan to Hafnia Holding.  Per Kaalund and County Manager Bo Smith reject out of hand that politicians have any responsibility for the position of the loan.

"It is a purely administrative task over which the county politicians have no influence," says Kaalund.

According to the advisers at Gudme Rasschou, they have only acted as intermediary in the loan to Hafnia Holding.

"We provided advice on taking out the foreign loan itself, and we proposed that the county deposit its money with Hafnia Merchant Bank," says director Eigil Pedersen, who is also a partner at Gudme Raaschou.
