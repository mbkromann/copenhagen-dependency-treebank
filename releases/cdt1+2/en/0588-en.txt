Doors for residences, front doors as well as back doors, balcony doors and terrace doors, should be solid and equipped with good safe locks.  A supplemental lock in a door increases the thief's work considerably.  Remember that a lock wears out and often should be changed after approximately 10 years of normal use.


The tumbler lock 

"The tumbler lock" is a simple but safe type of lock.  It may be found in several versions and placed into the edge of the door, precluding thereby direct attack on the mechanism.  When the key in a "tumbler lock" is turned to the lock position, the latch/catch bolt should be in its outermost position with at least a 10 mm catch.
