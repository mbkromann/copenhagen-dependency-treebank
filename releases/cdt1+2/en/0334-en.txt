I don't know whether I am getting bored or whether I am just lazy.  I should look around town, but I can't pull myself together and content myself with looking kindly on an Englishman who has arrived too late for the plane to Botswana.  He cannot see anything at all.  He is way too drunk.


Perhaps, it is because of the Norwegians.  They all speak Swahili to each other, and I assume that they have been to a language course, which is very commendable, but Swahili with a Norwegian accent sounds strange.  It is bad enough that the natives speak English with a Swahili accent, but here at the hotel, the black waiters have begun to speak English with a  Norwegian Swahili accent, and that is rather stiff.


From the terrace, I can look out on the parking lot, where nothing at all is happening.  No, now there comes a girl who is quite certainly not Norwegian.
