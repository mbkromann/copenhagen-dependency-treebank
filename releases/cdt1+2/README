This directory contains versions 1 and 2 of the Copenhagen Dependency
Treebanks (CDT): 

* Version 1 (the directory "da") was orginally called the Danish
  Dependency Treebank. It was used in the CoNLL 2006 shared task on
  dependency parsing, but has since been updated with bug fixes and an
  improved CoNLL conversion which includes a decomposition of the
  PAROLE part-of-speech tags into the underlying features for number,
  gender, etc.).
	
* Version 2 (the directories "da", "en", and "da-en") is a superset of
  Version 1 with a parallel word-aligned treebank for English, using
  the same annotation scheme as in Version 1; this extended treebank
  was originally referred to as the Parallel Danish-English Dependency
  Treebank. 

For the license and a description of the different versions
of the treebanks, please consult:

Note that the planned version 3 of the CDT treebanks will be a
an improved and revised superset of Version 2, with a more
fine-grained inventory of relations for adverbials, morphology,
discourse, semantics, and coreference.
