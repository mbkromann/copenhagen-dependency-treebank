This directory contains versions 1 and 2 of the Copenhagen Dependency
Treebanks (CDT): 

* Version 1 (the directory "da") was orginally called the Danish
  Dependency Treebank. It was used in the CoNLL 2006 shared task on
  dependency parsing, but has since been updated with bug fixes and an
  improved CoNLL conversion. 
	
* Version 2 (the directories "da", "en", and "da-en") is a superset of
  Version 1 with additional annotations for English, using the same
  annotation scheme as in Version 1; it was originally referred to as
  the Parallel Danish-English Dependency Treebank. 

For the license and a description of the different versions
of the treebanks, please consult:

Note that the planned version 3 of the CDT treebanks will be a
an improved and revised superset of Version 2, with a more
fine-grained inventory of syntactic relations.
