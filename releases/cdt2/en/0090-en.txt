Danish culture must be created, administered, cared for and pampered by us Danes.  It is our idiosyncrasy and lifestyle.  The best we have.

The repertoire of the Royal Theatre is railed against in the debate.  Film people are moaning about lack of funding, while authors rip the heads off each other.  At the same time, we shrink from buying expensive books, desert the cinemas, and watch TV instead of going to the theatre.

There is nothing new in any of that, except for the fact that the culture war has gradually taken on the nature of a theatrical farce than serious debate.

Of course, the Byzantine appointment of a new theatre head at the Danish Royal Theatre has a certain entertainment value, and gossip is not to be scorned in a provincial society.

This is one side of the matter.  The other is that people never speak about your responsibility and mine as ordinary consumers of culture.

It is not good form among us cultural mediators to say that the audience also has a responsibility.  But let's slaughter the sacred cow.
