- Not everyone.  Your mother was very slim and athletic.  When she was expecting our daughter, you almost couldn't tell before the seventh month.  She carried well, as we say back home in Denmark.

- There must have been another man, Loulou stated matter-of-factly. - Didn't you notice that she had another man?

Bernie sat silently for a long time, then he leaned forward towards the other person and looked penetratingly at her.

- Your mother and I loved each other, you have to understand.  We met in Paris and it was love at first sight.  She was not a woman with secret love affairs, she never lied.

- She lied to me.  She led me to believe that you were my father.

- She presumably had her reasons, Loulou.  It can't have been easy for her to return to her parents under those conditions.  She may have been forced to keep silent about the truth and, gradually, she repressed it entirely.  It was simpler for her ? and also for you.  She must have acted out of love for you.
