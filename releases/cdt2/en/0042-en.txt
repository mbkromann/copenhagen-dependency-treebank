Minister for Finance Henning Dyremose is making a successful implementation of the Finance Act of 1991 into a battering ram to achieve results in other explosive political areas - education, the labour market and taxes.

"I aim to use the negotiations on the Finance Act as a battering ram for results in other areas.

A sensible Finance Act can lead to other initiatives being implemented, so that low wage and cost developments are assured in the collective bargaining agreements," says Henning Dyremose to B.T..

In addition to the Finance Act, which will have its first reading on Thursday, the KV government has proposed 22 bills that cover everything from a reduction of unemployment insurance dues to an elimination of the 6 percent tax on income up to DKK 200,000.

Henning Dyremose does not believe that a reduction of VAT and fees will help assure a more restrained collective bargaining result.

REDUCED VAT 

"Honestly speaking, I doubt that firms and businesses will lower prices to the same extent that we would lower VAT and fees," says Henning Dyremose.
