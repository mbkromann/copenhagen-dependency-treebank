According to H. P. Clausen, it should have happened at the end of March 1989, when Ninn-Hansen was making noises about wanting a tribunal of inquiry.  The result of the conversation was a clear warning against raking things up in the Tamil case.  A warning that never reached Poul Schlüter - says Poul Schlüter.

His total denial that he received this information hits his own permanent secretary Peter Wiese very hard, since Wiese has not concealed that, repeatedly, he was thoroughly informed by Poul Lundbæk Andersen - and has explained that he passed the information on to "the boss" Prime Minister Poul Schlüter.

TOLD ABOUT "THE KNOTTY PROBLEMS"

Poul Lundbæk Andersen met with Peter Wiese on March 29,1989, when Poul Lundbæk Andersen discussed all "the knotty problems" in the Tamil case.  "The knotty problems" was a review of all the dangerous pitfalls for the government - right from the beginning to Ninn-Hansen's claim that the government stood behind him to the way the Ministry of Justice put a stop to the ombudsman.
