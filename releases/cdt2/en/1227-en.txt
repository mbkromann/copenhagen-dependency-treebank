"But now I will not get a penny, even though I am Danish and writing for Danes.  I feel I've been treated extraordinarily unfairly and wonder why I am the one who is hit," she says.

According to the Danish National Library Authority, which administers the lending right fee, "over two dozen" Danish illustrators are hit by the new law, and quite a few authors of textbooks in foreign languages in the future must resign themselves to very reduced income.

"If it is a Danish book with a little foreign language in it, then it may well receive the lending right fee, but typical textbooks in foreign languages cannot be considered," says library consultant Anna Johansen, the Danish National Library Authority.
