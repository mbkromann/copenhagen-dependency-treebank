With a new, stylish, black-white vignette and Warhol pastiches as the studio scenography, "Synnøve's" has in the fall season's first broadcast on TV 3 gotten rid of the introductory rounds' low-budget feel.  On the other hand, it has seemed lately as if the hostess has put more pressure on her own load-bearing role - for example, in this instance, a striptease the undersigned unfortunately never was able to see.

Between the big boys from the gossip press and sturdy girls, such as Maiken Wexøe and Lone Dybkjær, however, Synnøve appeared a bit more subdued in the previous day's show - perhaps, because the patent leather dress was so tight that it creaked when she gestured too much!  The subject was gossip, and it is typical that Synnøve is best, when she is personally engaged in the material; when she uses her own life as the emotional springboard for her otherwise quick, spontaneous remarks.  So, even though it was only Maiken Wexø, who criticised the end and the means of the gossip press from her own experiences, it was, therefore, one of the programmes in which the hostess probably reached her goal of an entertaining, well-shot sequence without short circuits along the way.
