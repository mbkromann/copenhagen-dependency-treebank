Got into the Citroën from 1926

Prince Henrik arrived at Viborg yesterday in one of the military's roaring helicopters.  But he did Viborg in a nice, two-banger Citroën B 12 from 1926.

The helicopter pilot lifted off the landing pad at Nørresø Collegium immediately and left the responsibility to Gitte Laursen of Højbjerg near Rødkærsbro.  Gitte Laursen was ready in her shiny Citroën.

-  I have driven around 30,000 kilometers in it over the past 10 years, but the drive today is my most exciting, said Gitte Laursen, before she chugged away with Prince Henrik, Mayor J. Cato Nielsen and the Prince's adjutant.

A whole motorcade of old Citroëns followed after Gitte Laursen's car.  Viborg's director of tourism, Jørn Grønkjær Jensen - who himself has fooled around with Citroëns - had assembled a fine field.

Quick craftsmen

Before the drive, the Prince participated in topping-out ceremony for the Nørresø Collegium.  The rector of the Agricultural University, Bent Schmidt-Nielsen, bid the guests welcome and explained the idea for the DKK 12 million expensive donation from the Agricultural Council of Denmark.  The collegium is to secure the lines of communication between the Agricultural University and the Foulum Research Laboratory.
