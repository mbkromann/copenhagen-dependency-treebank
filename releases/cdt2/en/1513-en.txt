"It is incredible that Per Henriksen make himself fire off these remarks.  For if there is anything he had done, it is to continue building up the deficit.  And he has never lived up to our agreements.  I will quite clearly encourage future coaches at BMS to demand a bank guarantee.

Nor have I ever received a reply to the promises of a bonus, where just an apology could have done wonders," stresses Peter Freil.
