The weekend's division football was saved at the last moment.

The Danish division players have agreed with the Division Association to negotiate instead of striking and, yesterday, the football players decided to call off the actions that would put a stopper in all football for the weekend.

Now, the parties are appointing a common committee, to which each party proposes three men - one of whom must be a lawyer.

And otherwise, before May 3, they must have worked out a new standard agreement and another transfer system to replace what had been approved at the DBU's meeting of delegates and which the players believe provides them unreasonable terms and conditions.

For the sake of the negotiation climate, the Division Association is encouraging clubs to renounce the right to enter into new contracts, as long as the negotiations are ongoing.  If new contracts cannot be avoided - even though both associations also urge waiting - then the two parties recommend in the strongest terms that the old transfer provisions from before March 9 be used.
