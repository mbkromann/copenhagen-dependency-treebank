Michael: "Yes, because I still do not understand how in heaven's name you could vote us down to a third to the last place.  If we had been number five or six, then, okay - even though we almost thought we were going to win.

We learned some things down there, which I hope DR has also taken to heart.

Among other things, you have to do a cool video with super-sound for presentation programmes.  We sent a copy from the finale in Ã…rhus, and it sounded so awful - ushh!  We lost a lot on that."

Anders: "And then DR has to learn that it is no use just showing up with a good melody, a good soloist and a talented chorus.  The goods have to be sold, coldly and cynically.  The Swedes were quite incredible.  The whole team in designer Carola jackets, cocktail parties that topped everything, and a producer who had the whole camera sequence ready to the last detail for Italian television.  Like that.  No mistakes, and just look at the result."
