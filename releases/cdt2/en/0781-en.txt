"It is quite clear that investments abroad will rise a bit in the coming years.  But we are not rushing forward blindly, so that is why for some time to come we are only talking about the purchase of stocks in foreign companies that have Danish subsidiaries".  

ATP director Palle Simonsen will not say too much, when he has to comment on future investment strategy.  He realises that every little movement from ATP will be followed closely by the Danish stock market because of ATP's very large significance for the stock market.

Palle Simonsen says that, at the moment, there is a board resolution to purchase foreign stocks and bonds for up to 1.5 percent of the asset portfolio.

Without wanting to commit to any particular percentage, Palle Simonsen does not hide that ATP in five-ten years will have a significantly larger share of foreign securities in its holdings.  He believes that it is a natural development in a capital market that is on its way towards completely abolishing any form of barriers across national boundaries.
