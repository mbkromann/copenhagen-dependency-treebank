The above-referenced long list and factors are compared as a starting point for a discussion of the so-called "Japanese economic miracle".

The discussion of the explanation for the "Japanese economic miracle" has particularly turned on the extent to which one could be satisfied with economic factors in one's explanation or whether it is also necessary to bring in special cultural and historical circumstances to find a reasonable explanation.

In this connection, economists from the Southeast Asian countries have drawn attention to the fact that several of the countries in the area have had growth rates that are just as large as Japan's, so they must be brought into the considerations, if one is to explain "the Japanese miracle".

VI. Living conditions, social groupings and family life


1. The living standard 

The living standard in Japan has been constantly rising since the 2nd World War.  Real wages in particular in the period 1960-73 have risen more strongly than prices, a tendency that has certainly continued after 1973, but here the rise has been very little.  A mark of improvement in nutrition is that the average height of Japanese 14-year olds from 1958-1978 rose 8.9 cm, and the average weight rose by 5.5 kg during the same period of time.
