And then there was the matter of the waiting lists that had to go.  In TEBA's case, John Winther did this by taking in all the young people on the waiting list.  It was that simple.  This means in TEBA's case that, from being 45 children in 1991, there will be 55 children in 1992, so we're talking about an increase of more than 10 percent.  It speaks for itself that TEBA's space will not be expanded for that reason.  It is not the intent to put in with one hand what is taken with the other. 

In 1992, there were two square metres allotted per child.  And here, it is like the calculation of housing rent, we include everything.  Toilets, hallways, the teachers' lounge, and so on.

A good-sized young person of five years weighs around 19 kilos.  As distributed in two square metres.  That is 9.5 kilos per square metre.  Or approximately 1,050 square centimetres per kilo of child.
