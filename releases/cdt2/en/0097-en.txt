"Henning Dyremose is our man.  He is talented and likeable, but whether he is Finance Minister or it is Mogens Lykketoft of the Social Democrat Party is like the difference between a Carlsberg and a Tuborg.  They have different labels, but the content is from the same barrel.

We have supported Schlüter to this point and will continue to do so.  We would rather have a non-socialist government than a Social Democratic one, but the KV government governs entirely at the mercy of the Social Democratic Party.  Therefore, we have few strong feelings particularly connected to keeping life in the present government," says the group chairman for the Progress Party, Aage Brusgaard.

In the situation in which Schlüter decides to leave, Aage Brusgaard will not point to Dyremose:

"We will probably rely on an earlier decision always to point to the leader of the largest non-socialist party.

SHARPER PROFILE

But Industry Minister Anne Birgitte Lundholt could be a possibility.  She has good positions, is diligent and trustworthy.  She could be a fine head of a future non-socialist government, which would thereby have a far sharper profile," says Aage Brusgaard.
