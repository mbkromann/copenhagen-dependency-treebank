One of the country's legal experts in the jungle of cooperative housing is real estate broker, Svend Trangeled, J.D., from the law firm of Niels Gesner, Copenhagen.  He says that it is particularly housing co-operatives and partnership arrangements that are subject to pitfalls.  There is a distinct difference in how these structures work - not only with respect to ownership, but also with respect to taxes.  Just as one must be entirely clear how one is liable for the finances of the cooperative.

Partnerships are deemed in certain circles - especially, certain political ones - as an evasion of the law on co-operative housing and, therefore, it is not the structure Svend Trangeled would recommend first and foremost.

It is also here that one actually does not own one's residence.  One owns, rather, a share in the assets of the partnership, which owns the residence - to which one has a right of use.  And here the bylaws play a decisive role, says Trangeled, who recommends that at any rate one ally oneself with an expert, when establishing a cooperative.  Also to be sure that there will not be tax problems.
