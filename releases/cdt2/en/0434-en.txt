You must not give a long lecture on why you want to present things the way you do.  On the other hand, it can provide an impression of perspective and assurance, if you start by briefly outlining the main points of what you intend to say.  But watch out that you don't promise more than you can deliver.

Try to put yourself in the place of a teacher and a censor.  If you're part of a reading group in which you are examined orally together, then try to pay attention to what you react to in your comrades' presentation.  What do you think is good?  And what is bad?  An ordinary human reaction is that it is easier to subtract from than to add to, when you assess the efforts of others.  Teachers and censors may be that way as well and, therefore, you must first and foremost practice avoiding making stupid mistakes, when you are sitting at the green table.

If you have preparation time, then use it constructively.  Find out what it is exactly they are asking of you and don't panic, if the questions take you by surprise.
