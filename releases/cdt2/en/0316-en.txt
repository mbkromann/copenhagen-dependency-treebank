-  Apropos collective, Regitze  -  Loa smiles at me  -  I know one here in town, where there lives a girl who has sort of a weekend boyfriend relationship!  In fact, they need somebody to move in right now, so you can try there!  The girl I know is called Anne and she has guy in Copenhagen.  Then, a crazy theatrical artist and three musicians live there, so it is at any rate creative.  And you and Anne must have something to talk about!


-  Very funny.  But -  yes, why not?


Turning it over.  Feeling my way around, every so often with such an incredible stubbornness and intensity.  Because even though it is my problem, and Bente's is another variant, and Inger's a third, it is as if there must be a common denominator somewhere.  All the patterns in us that are so alike, nevertheless - in spite of all the different things our minds can think.  All the pieces we can put together.
