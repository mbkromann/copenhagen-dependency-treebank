By giving notice of a debate in Parliament on Wednesday on the Maastricht Treaty, which should lead to a referendum, Prime Minister Major wanted to force the rebels to support the government.  If the government lost the majority, the Prime Minister would step down and, perhaps, even call for elections, he threatened.

Both the Conservative Eurosceptics and the opposition Labour Party protested against this tactic.  They reminded the Prime Minister of his promise not to begin the final ratification process in Parliament, until there had been a clarification of Denmark's EC initiative.  Many Labour politicians, who were otherwise supporters of Maastricht, also believe that it would really come down to a vote of confidence for the government and not a true vote on the treaty. 

From no to yes

Most of Major's opponents had to admit yesterday that the Danish EC initiative made it impossible for them to object to the government beginning the ratification process.  Various Eurosceptics even said that they were no longer considering voting against the government during the critical parliamentary debate next week.
