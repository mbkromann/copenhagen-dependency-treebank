The Brothers of the Order of St. John meet at Kronborg once a year in crusader costume and with medieval ceremonies in memory of the fact that they represent a movement going back almost 1,000 years in time.

Rich merchants from Amalfi, Italy, financed in the 900s the establishment of a hospital in Jerusalem to which thousands of pilgrims from Europe came.  Around this hospital was formed a noble order of knights, which both participated in the Crusades as warriors and helped sick and poor pilgrims.

After the Crusades, these knights of the Order of St. John were banished from the Holy Land and later lived many places in Europe, for almost 300 years at Malta, from which they also for a time took their name, the Knights of Malta.

Napoleon threw the knights out of Malta and later around the year 1800 the Order of St John was scattered all over Europe with chapters of the order in many countries that did not mutually recognize each other and claimed to have the exclusive right to be heirs of the medieval knightly order.

Common to the still existing national chapters of the order are both the evident snobbery for titles and orders and the philanthropic activities of various sorts.
