TRABANTS ON FIRE

The last couple of nights, the Nazis used parked Trabants to barricade the streets.  These small plastic cars were set on fire to keep the police at a distance.  Since there is no longer a foreigner for miles around, the police and press have been the primary target for aggression and violence, and the residents are raging again.

Today, they suddenly think that the riots have gone too far.  It has never been their intent that the Trabants should be lost in the heat of battle.  That some West German TV companies have had camera equipment worth millions ruined is less tragic to the people in Lichtenhagen.

Now thousands of left-wing and right-wing extremists are on their way to Rostock.  They will fight for and against racism, and they will fight against each other.  "Violence tourism," it is called.

The whole city is waiting in fear and tension.  The weekend may be a long and bloody one.  The Nazis promised to continue until September 1, the day the Second World War started in 1939.  Pure hell can break loose at any time.  People here asked for it themselves.  Now, they cannot stop it.
