"I am looking forward to autumn, when I can move into my apartment and get going on my studies and establish a daily routine.

The many free hours, however, have given me the tranquility to consider my whole situation.

I know what I want - have a handle on the future.

In the fall, I am starting at HH, and then the plan is that I am going to study at the Danish Business Academy for Exports here in Ã…rhus.

My time abroad was appealing to me.  And it is not impossible that I will go abroad again.  At any rate, I still have a number of contacts in Brussels as well as in Norwich, and it is, of course, possible that I will use these contacts, when my studies are finished."

Henrik Mortensen has - like all other Danish professionals abroad - quite a few pennies in his bankbook.

Money that is invested and which the unfortunate player hopes not to touch in the coming years.
