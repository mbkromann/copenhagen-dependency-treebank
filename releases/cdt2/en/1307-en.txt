"When we began the recording of "Chicism," we had really thought that we would use the hip-hop genre as our starting point, though we quickly discovered that we were better at playing music with real instrumentation, instead of using tons of drum machines and computer sampling.

It just did not sound like Chic.  So, at the risk of being accused of being retro and old-fashioned, we stuck to our concept, which is fun music, music that can be danced to," says Nile Rodgers.

FEEL THE RUSH

"We no longer need to sell 10 million albums and sit studying the charts and hit lists for fear of failing.  We have made "Chicism," because we wanted to go out and tour, to be on stage and feel that rush.  In a way, we have returned to our beginnings with the new album, which screams to be done live - so, hopefully, we are coming back to Denmark in the summer," says Bernhard Edwards.
