A shock in a world that has been used to growth - and, as a rule, strong growth.

But even though total investment fell, it rose significantly for certain types of hardware, namely personal computers, workstations and small and medium-sized systems for multiple users - all to this extent dealing with machines with a Unix monitoring system.  Here, investment rose by an average of 12 percent.

"The Unix part of smaller multiple user systems attained approximately half of the sales in the '90s.  In 1996, the Unix part will be 70-80 percent," predicts Per Andersen from the analysis firm of IDC Scandinavia and who is responsible for the analysis of the Unix market.

"Unix will not overtake the dominance of DOS on the desktop.  Unix's role is in the server.  And Unix is not a substitute for former systems but is to be a supplement.  The personal computer did not kill the mainframe, but first and foremost revolutionised the use of word processing and other simple applications."  Hardware without interest In this market - Unix and open systems, which ultimately are to make it possible to transfer applications between different multiple user systems - there is a stiff competition at the moment.
