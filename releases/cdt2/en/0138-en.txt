HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING

The witness reacted this way: "I know.  But I haven't seen anything anymore, if anyone asks."

He is reacting to two things: the behaviour of the accused in court and the court's acceptance of this behaviour and, then, the fact that, at each break, witnesses, spectators and the accused were in one big mix in the court's waiting room.

"It is to be under constant pressure.  And it is not to be tolerated," he says.

The second thing is: "Now, five days after the close of the case, I get my witness compensation.

I was paid for a 30 km drive at the state's lowest rate, DKK 1.15 per km.  I can't run a car for that.

I should have the state's highest, DKK 2.13 per km.  And remember that someone driving an official car has to pay tax of three crowns per km to the state.

Then I got DKK 200 for a work day of ten hours.

LOSES DKK 2,000

The judge says that people give DKK 40 for each two hours begun.  That's quite unreasonable: I lose DKK 2,000 on a day like that."
