All the gains - and a bit more - went to the trunk

If we put Autograph's x-rays of the new and the previous 80s on top of each other, we see - surprisingly - that the cabin has shrunk a bit!  From a roominess index of 8,869 to 8,805 mm (the sum of the cabin's 9 most important measurements).

This minor loss is due to the fact that the slightly sloping rear seat back is pushed forward 15 mm.  That the height above the front and back seats has diminished by, respectively, 10 and 8 mm and that the width at shoulder height front/back lost, respectively, 4 and 10 mm.  On the other hand, the maximum leg room in the driver's seat went up from 1,069 to 1,082 mm with an unchanged seat height.  A max. leg room that is a treat for a super-longlegged person.

With a price of DKK 280,000, the Audi 80 2.0E is surrounded by competitors, the majority of which have a total roominess 1-2 classes larger.  Both outside and inside.  With its roominess index at 8,805 mm, only BMW's 3 series has a hair-breadth's less cabin in a price class that is topped by roominess-giants, such as Citroen XM, Opel Omega and Peugeot 605.
