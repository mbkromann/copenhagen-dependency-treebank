I complained on May 20 to the Ombudsman that the Minister for the Environment, even though he had stopped the IBM proposal because of the lack of hearing on the amendment to the regional plan, had at the same time reported that the proposal did not conflict with the guidelines that had been given for amending the regional plan.  Because it did, and it does.

When Christian Christensen followed the half promise up with final approval on August 9, I also complained about this to the Ombudsman.

Now the Ombudsman says he cannot handle these two complaints, because a subsequent consultation had been held with Parliament's environmental and planning committee, and because a proposal from VS and SF on expropriation of the IBM property "is at the moment under consideration by Parliament".

The explanation for the rejection is that the Ombudsman only can take a position with respect to matters relating to administrative business.  I have not tried to get him to do anything else.

But since the judgment as to what degree Parliament is implicated has been invented as well as decided by the Ombudsman, the rejection must merely be taken cognizance of.
