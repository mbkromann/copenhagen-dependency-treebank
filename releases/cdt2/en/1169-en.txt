Another interesting point on the list of Clinton sights is McClard√Ås Bar-B-Que, where the later presidential candidate gathered with his friends on warm summer evenings.

Everybody, of course, went to the "in spot" in a car and, according to the legend that is now under construction about the city's new pride, Hot Springs has neither before nor since seen a Buick with tail fins as big as young Clinton's Natural leadership abilities.

Bill Clinton first lived at the 1011 Park Avenue address, from which one could walk to the city's best hamburger hangouts.  But later, the family moved to a larger house in more airy surroundings farther from downtown.

The neighbour across the street tells that, even in his youth, Clinton showed natural leadership abilities.  "I don't know he did it.  But he led the other boys and they followed him", says Margie Weger.

The neighbourhood carports contain one big showy car after another, as if time has stood still since the '50s.  It is not popular to buy imported cars in this part of the US, and smaller cars really stand out in the street scene.
