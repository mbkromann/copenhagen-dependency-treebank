Danish humour is somewhat more dark and gloomy than the humour of the south, which is more open and says things directly.  Our humour is black and indirect.  Maybe, it goes with the fact that we are colder, are indoors more, and become depressed in the winter.  When we have parties, it really has to be something we can remember for a long time afterwards.  The French, for example, meet in a more relaxed way, they have another way of being together than we do. 

Danish and English humours resemble each other a lot.  Danes like to make fun of politics, we have the freedom for this.  In other countries, it is more aimed at religion and the handicapped.  But our form of humour is nice, I think.

Scandinavian comics are also different from each other.  The Swede prepares himself thoroughly.  The Norwegian just goes in and does it, while the Dane asks: Shouldn't we have a little break, so we can talk about it first!
