3.  -  My bicycle is flat, and I would really like to go to aerobics ?

1.  -  The '80s and Jane Fonda, which started it all with cultivating one's body.  We are in the process of turning away from this, here in the '90s, we are just on an eco-trip, for instance, using biodynamic lipstick.

2.  - I would probably have a face lift done at some point, or if I ever get a beer belly, then I would have liposuction.  I don't think I would be able to do without my hair, so if I became balding or bald, I would have a hair transplant done.

3.  -  I love to watch sports.  I have myself gone to countless different sports - in fact, everything with the exception of football.  My father is a football coach, you know.

-  Now I'm dancing jazz ballet, and it's so fun to be a boy in a dance troupe.  You get looked after a little bit more, because there are mostly girls ?
