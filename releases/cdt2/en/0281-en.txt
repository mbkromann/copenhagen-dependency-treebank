The meal begins with various small appetisers, and sometimes you eat so many of them that you can hardly fight your way through the main course.

There are, for example, Tarana, a salad prepared with fish eggs, tacik (yoghurt with cucumber, carrot and garlic), dolma (marinaded grape leaves filled with rice and spices) and börek (pastry filled with cheese or meat).

Lamb is the basis for many Turkish main dishes, but you can also get poultry, beef and fish.

There are also a lot of beautiful desserts.  Myself, on a summer day, I enjoy finishing a meal with fresh fruit in small cubes drenched with treacle and chopped nuts.  Wonderful!

You can drink it - but watch out!

-  Turkish men almost always drink raki with their meal.  It is a spirit with liquorice flavour, and it is reminiscent of Greek ouzo.  Raki is thinned with water and gets an innocent milky appearance, which you should not, however, be fooled by!

There are also good wines, and if you prefer beer, you can choose between the local pilsner, Efes, or a license-manufactured beer from, for example, Tuborg and Lövenbräu.
