-  Tourists are wild about Danish elves and gladly pay DKK 50 for the little elves and DKK 150 for the big ones, says Erik Karlsson.


CHRISTMAS AT AN ORPHANAGE

Erik Karlsson is a bachelor and has always lived alone.  He loves Christmas and celebrates it in his home all the way up until Twelfth Night, where he ends the festival by lighting three candles and enjoying one last time the bands of elves that decorate sofas and chairs, tables, shelves, window sills and floor.

Even though Erik Karlsson likes to find old dolls at flea markets and at Christmas bazaars to later dress them in elf costumes, and even though his own favourite elf is a container find with a rubber head, whom he has given a wig and elf clothes, all the others are created by himself.

From his earliest years as a boy, he has been good at knitting and has had an aptitude for sewing and embroidering and, after knitting a sea of socks, sweaters, caps and mittens, he began some years ago to make elves.
