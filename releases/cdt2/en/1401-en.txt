"We chose Jette Dreyer Hughes' agency, because she is a trained psychologist. 
So, we thought that she was particularly serious.  But, actually, in my opinion, she abuses her education as a psychologist just to milk people of their money.

There is only one of the women I know who had contact with a like-minded person.  They just didn't fit together, when it came down to it.

The four women have heard nothing from her in a year, while the two others have received one contact address each, which did not correspond at all to their desires for a man.

One of my friends did not hide the fact that she wanted an intelligent and well to do man, when she was interviewed by Jette Dreyer.

A week later, she was called with the happy message: "I have the perfect man for you: A bank director in Rungsted.  There is just one problem.  He still loves his former wife".
