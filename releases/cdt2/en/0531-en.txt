Two convicted executives of the July 6 Bank, chairman of the board Niels Johan Leer and director John Olsdorf, appealed their judgment on the spot from the Copenhagen Municipal Court with a demand for acquittal.  The prosecuting authority has also reserved the possibility of appeal.


The chairman of the board received a year and a half in jail and a fine of DKK one million for fraudulent abuse of authority, tax fraud of a particularly gross nature, and violation of the Danish Companies Act and the Commercial Banks and Savings Banks Act.  The bank's director John Olsdorff received 6 months in jail and a fine of DKK 90,000.


Both are charged with having inflicted a loss on the bank of around DKK 60 million through reckless and illegal loans.  They have also evaded payments to the tax authorities in the amount of DKK 3.5 million.


Two rank and file board members were acquitted.  The municipal court judge Nils Erik 
Jensen, however, did not hide the fact that the board members could not go home with a clear conscience. 


-  The acquittal is in no way a seal of approval that they have done their board work in an exemplary fashion - that is far from the case, the judge interjected in his remarks on the judgment.
