But two days later in a similar case, a fellow judge in Lyngby decided to follow the usual interpretation: It is illegal to call a member of the Danish Union - the expelled CD member Erik Dagø - a "cultural racist".  Nevertheless, Judge Jette Krog did not find Dagø entitled to compensation, because the statements may well have been made "in good faith".

Both judgments have been appealed to the High Court, respectively, by the Danish Union and director Jens Sejersen, who was sued in both cases.

In judicial circles, people find it peculiar that, in the same week, two judges decided similar cases so differently.

"But judges are different," declares Professor Vagn Greve, Lic. Jur.

He considers it "highly unusual" for a municipal court judge to make a decision that is different from a recent High Court decision.

Justice is the same outcome "A material element in the concept of justice is that things have the same outcome, no matter where they come up.  However, defamation cases are clear borderline cases, and there may arise problems of doubt.  That is what you have the High Court and the Supreme Court to decide," says Vagn Greve.
