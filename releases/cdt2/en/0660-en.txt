She became her team's top scorer with six goals, while Betina Nørager accounted for no fewer than eight of the home team's.

Despite the efforts in Saturday's IHF Cup match against Romanian Textila Zalau, Viborg was strong enough to tear apart next to last ranked, AIA, with 24-12 at Grønløkke Hall.

AIA kept up to 7-7 and, at the break, Viborg led by only 12-9, but in the second half, there was a class difference between the two teams in favour of the guests.

Here, AIA did not get on the scoring list, until there were eight minutes remaining and, in the meantime, Viborg with five goals in a row had increased its lead to 17-9.

The sternlight Roar likewise had to accept a clear defeat, as Horsens in front of its own fans registered only its third victory in the season by winning 22-13 over the newly advanced Zealanders.  Horsens' closest previous victory dated all the way back to the tournament's second round on September 29.  At that time, the opponent was also called Roar.

However, the showdown was far from as one-sided as the numbers indicate, because, in the middle of the second half, the scoreboard showed only 14-12 in favour of the home team.
