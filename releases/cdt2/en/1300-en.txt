But there are others in the family who can.  Now it is little sister, Jennifer Tilly, who is haunting the wings.

This need not be an unqualified advantage, even though Meg Tilly has created something of a name for herself - especially in the film "The Big Chill" and later "Valmont".

In fact - since Jennifer Tilly, who is a year younger than her big sister Meg, has also begun to go after the slightly heavier roles - they have almost bumped heads, when roles are to be cast.

"It has happened that we have both gone after the same role and then we both backed out again, so that it wound up with a completely different third person getting the part," says Jennifer Tilly, who is best known for her somewhat daring roles.

"When I was going to audition for my first film part (Moving Violations), I showed up in a very tight dress.  I thought: this is what Hollywood wants, they have to think you are sexy."
