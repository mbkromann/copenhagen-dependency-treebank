RATHER ACQUIT

In his very straightforward and objective charge to the jury, the presiding judge, High Court Judge Ole Unmack Larsen, had provided a hint about which way it was going:

"The evidence must be so strong that it cannot leave any reasonable doubt.  It is not enough to say that, if it is not Ove Hansen, who is the killer, then?

As a power monopoly, the Danish legal system cannot allow itself to make a mistake by putting an innocent person in prison.  Rather acquit too many than too few."

The presiding judge maintained that it was not the jury's task to solve a murder mystery or to tie up all the loose ends days of witness examinations had left.

CIRCUMSTANCIAL EVIDENCE TOO WEAK

Since the prosecutor had no directly incriminating, technical evidence against Ove Hansen, it was the jury's task solely to assess whether the total sum of circumstantial evidence was strong enough to say that Pedal-Ove was a killer.
