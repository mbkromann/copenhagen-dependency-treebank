MEET TWICE

As mentioned, the season will begin on March 16 with the showdown between AGF and Brøndby, followed the day after by games between: Ikast-Lyngby, B 1903-Silkeborg, AaB-Vejle and FremOB.

The 10 teams in the Super League will meet twice during the spring, and this will then provide 18 rounds with the finish on June 23, when the program will look like this:

Lyngby-Brøndby, Silkeborg-AGF, Vejle-Ikast, Frem-B 1903 and AaB-OB.

The Division Association will not take a position on what will happen after the summer vacation until the annual general meeting on January 26.

It will likewise be decided here whether the tournament will be turned on its head so that, as opposed to the practice up to this point, it will be played fall/spring.

If that is the case, the year's Danish champion will be chosen on June 23.

Without, however, achieving much more than the honor, because the DM gold, contrary to custom, will not give entry to the Europe Cup tournaments.

If, however, against all expectations, a majority in the Division Association were to want to keep the tournament as spring/fall, two teams will pull out of the Super League.

Then, the eight teams in the best position from the fall will play for the championship in an all-against-all playoff.
