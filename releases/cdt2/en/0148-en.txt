The ham to be used in the dish must not be too salty.  You cannot use the thin slices, which are packaged in the refrigerated counter.  They are too salty and too wet and the flavour is not good enough.

Butter an oven-proof dish, more or less large enough so that each slice of ham, folded once, can be placed overlapping in the dish.

The sauce can be made well in advance.

Cut through the cleaned onions and then into smaller pieces across.  Some of the green top must be included.

Warm 25g butter and grape seed oil up in a large pan.  Fry the onion pieces lightly until they begin to get a little colour.  Pour the port into the pan and stir.  Let them steam for a couple of minutes.

Mix the tomato pur√©e and mustard in a bowl with 1 dl whipped cream.  Pour the mixture into the pan and stir.  Pour the rest of the cream in and let the sauce reduce a bit.
