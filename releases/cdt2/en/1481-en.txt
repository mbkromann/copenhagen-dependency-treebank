According to an old agreement entered into between the County of Northern Jutland and the Morticians National Association, Northern Jutland ward, the porters have been allowed to demand a sum of DKK 70 per body from the undertakers, whom they help lifting up the casket.

As the head of the hospital's porter group, no one has been able to contest the chief porter's permanent right to monopolize the shift at the chapel.  With around 300 deceased annually at Hobro Hospital, the helping hand to the undertakers has become an extra annual income of roughly DKK 20,000.

COMMON FUND

"The other porters believe that the money should be shared. Part has also gone to the porters' common petty cash fund.  Some have gone to taxes.  There has been between DKK 3,000 and DKK 5,000 net remaining for the head porter himself," says hospital director Karl Gaub to B.T.

"However, whether it is DKK 3,000 or three million is, for that matter, irrelevant.  The fact is that there is something fishy about this whole business.  And I cannot live with doubt being raised about the integrity of a colleague.  Not when it is a colleague at the middle management level.
