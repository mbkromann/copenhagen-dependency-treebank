The greenhouse was overgrown, the panes broken, Jens walked on his toe tips, soundlessly, because the plane's noise drowned out his crunching steps.

Of course, it had not been SÃ¸ren.  The recognition, the fleeting eye contact had been an illusion.  What looked like an escape had not been an escape, the man had only given a quite indifferent glance towards a car whose engine died - and had then gone on with what he had been doing.

Now, Jens could hear the plane begin to move.  He stood and drew air deep into his lungs, damp air with a bitter smell of failed crops and rust.

He could not see whether there was a door at the other end of the greenhouse.  There probably was.  And there were more greenhouses and, behind them, there was a building he had only seen the smallest part of.

He turned around and went out of the greenhouse again.  Just as he came out into the open, he was hit by something from above.  Not a blow, but a huge shadow.
