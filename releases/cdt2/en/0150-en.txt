 
(2nd edition)  The real estate company Norden wants to grow even bigger than it will be after the merger with one of the Hafnia group's companies, Public Limited Company of 15 April 1980.  The first interested companies have already appeared, after Norden yesterday officially announced that negotiations have put the consolidation with the Hafnia company into place.

"Hafnia and Norden are leaving the door open to others," says Preben Nygaard, who is director of Norden's parent company Commercial Holding International A/S.

After the merger, Hafnia will have at its disposal approximately 40 percent of the shares in Norden, which will be the continuing company.

But it is the intent that Hafnia's shares will gradually be throttled down to 25 percent as the new companies come through the door.  It is not the intent that Hafnia will have too great a say in it.  Future merger partners are not to be chased away for fear of being subject to the control of others.  Or in Preben Nygaard's words:

"If Hafnia has a majority, it may make others stay away."
