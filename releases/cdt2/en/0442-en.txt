On Friday, SID extended an invitation to a reception in the SID building on the occasion of its chairman Kjeld Christensen entering into the happy sixties.  The actual day, of course, is not until January 21, but when people are to gather, it is most practical to have it happen on a Friday, if anybody but the usual reception lions is to be there.


Is a Copenhagener

Only a few know that Kjeld Christensen was born in Copenhagen, bob,bob!  But he was saved for Jutland, since his entire growing-up period took place in Ã…rhus.  Kjeld Christensen came to agriculture as a 14-year old, but after a stint as a soldier, he arrived at a factory, where he worked for 18 years.  When the Korsholm School in Hinnerup was looking for a new janitor, Kjeld Christensen got the position.  He worked there for almost 10 years.

For eight years, he was on the city council in Hinnerup, elected by the Social Democrats, he has often been encouraged to let himself be put up again, after he moved to Hadsten, but the chairman of SID knows that a department chairman must represent everyone, and even though the Social Democrats are in the majority, SF and the Progress Party have been regular visitors to Vestergade.
