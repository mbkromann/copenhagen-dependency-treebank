Nor was there any comment to member of Parliament Arne Melchior's criticism, put forward the same date, that there was not a single active cancer researcher in the Danish Cancer Society's leadership.

The same fate met the primary question to Ole Bang in a contribution from me on October 13 about the extent to which the Danish Cancer Society considers itself a profit-oriented business or a mediator of contributions from the people to cancer research and patient support.

Indirectly, however, I get an answer in the finance manager's continued use of purely business arguments, for example, on collection activity.

The Danish Cancer Society seems to view contributors in the same way a Coca-Cola factory views consumers: as objects who must "be motivated" with modern marketing methods to purchase/contribute as much as possible.  I can well understand that marketing costs from the Danish Cancer Society's purely business point of view may well be approximately 1/3 of the "sale"; "the profit margin" on contributions ("pigeons for the plucking" the financial manager calls them) is, of course, 100 percent, so there will always be a "surplus".

However, I am certain that contributors do not find it reasonable that almost a third of what they give is used for advertising.
