The 8-year old boy from Thorning escaped from the accident with a fractured skull and some scrapes.

-  Miraculous, say the doctors and Falck.

Morten fell 25 metres down into a well


Morten fell this far down into the well: 25 m.  The Round Tower (right) is 36 m


Buckled in a harness to this winch, the 22-year old rescue worker Søren
Hansen was hoisted 25 metres down into the depths to rescue the severely injured boy


Here, two metres below rescue worker Søren Hansen was the entrance through which Morten entered.  Now, it has been covered over by the municipality with several hundred kilos of sand


Even the open skull fracture is healed very quickly


The mini-miniput player from Thorning will certainly play football again.  Just not this year, warn the doctors


At the base of Morten's head, the wound after the open skull fracture is already in the process of healing.  So is the ugly scar on his upper arm and the scrapes over most of his body.


Grim reminders - but improbably lucky outcome in relation to what happened only two weeks ago.
