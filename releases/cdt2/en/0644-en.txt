Car buyer's checklist

How many kilometres do we drive a year?  Important to know, if you are vacillating between a gasoline or a diesel-driven car.  You have to drive at least 20,000 km annually before a diesel engine will pay.  Also, because diesel cars are not good at small short trips.  When they are started, they should preferably be driven long and far.  Therefore, the diesel cars' share today is almost nil, when it comes to private cars.

Remember that kilometres also play a role in the selection of motor size.  If you drive many long trips, you should choose a car with an engine in the 1.6 - 1.8 or 2 litre class, because extra engine power also means a worse noise level and increased acceleration.
