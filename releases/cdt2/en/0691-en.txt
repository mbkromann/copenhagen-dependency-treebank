Thus, we approach one of the more recent Danish stamps that also tell a story of the Danish people and its ideals.

From Hungary come healthy athletes and from Africa a palette with hummingbirds - stamps from the Empire of the Sun make you giddy.

In Denmark, we have produced something the colour of fruit porridge that shows how Danish dog owners remove a dog turd from the sidewalk.  Most people are familiar with the stamp, which bears the text: Keep Denmark clean.

The illustration is simple: A dog turns its backside to its owner, who is presumably staring Pluto right in ? all the while, he is removing the turd with a mitten.

Now, only very few outside of Denmark understand the text, but if it should nevertheless wind up in a distant land, for example, Hungary, Barbados or Nigeria, one could easily get the impression that we were a boring, pragmatic people.  At any rate, the stamp does not go well on a letter with the message: PS!  I'm coming to Barbados in three days, a thousand kisses ?
