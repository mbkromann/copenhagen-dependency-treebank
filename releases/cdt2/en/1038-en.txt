But it was with the fricassee of pike and trout dish Preben Madsen landed his victory.  In addition to local judges, Erwin Lauterbach, Saison at Skovshoved Hotel, was on the panel of judges. Madsen gave me the recipe.  The ingredients are: 400g pike filet, 400g trout filet, 150g country ham in julienne strips, two small spring cabbages, a bunch of parsley, two dl vegetable bouillon, two thin leeks cut in rings, two teaspoons whole seed mustard, two teaspoons ordinary vinegar, 200g butter and salt and pepper.

Cut the fish in cubes, bake them on buttered baking sheets in the oven at 140 degrees.  The cabbage is cooked until tender.  The sauce: Steam the leek rings in vegetable bouillon, remove them, reduce the bouillon, add vinegar and mustard, stir in butter, add chopped parsley.

Serve the fish cubes with the cabbage and leek rings, pour a little of the sauce over the fish and sprinkle the ham on top.

You may also serve new potatoes baked in butter.

Preben Madsen, who is 31 years old, was trained at Hovborg Inn.  Since then, he has among other places, been at Pakhuset in Esbjerg, Hotel Plaza in Copenhagen and at Henne Kirkeby Inn.
