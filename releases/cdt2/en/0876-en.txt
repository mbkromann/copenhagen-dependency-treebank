Warm waffles and fresh strawberries

For the waffles, 2 large yolks are beaten with 1 T sugar, 1 t vanilla sugar and 1 pinch of salt.  Stir in 1 dl water.  Mix with 125 g flour, 1/2 t baking powder and 50 g roughly chopped nuts and beat the flour mixture into the eggs, until everything is well mixed.  Stir in 125 g warm melted butter.  Beat 2 whites until they are stiff and fold them into the batter.  Beat 1 dl whipping cream and fold in.  Let the batter rest covered for, at least, 1 hour.  It may stand several hours.  Stir the batter again lightly again before the waffles are baked.  The iron must be hot.  If it is Teflon-coated, you do not need to brush it with oil, except perhaps for the first waffle.  Approximately, 1 dl of batter is used for each waffle, and they are served crisp and golden, as soon as they are baked.  Serve with fresh or preserved strawberries and cold whipped cream.
