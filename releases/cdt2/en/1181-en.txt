The currency instability of recent weeks has provided an effective lesson on how fragile the conditions for economic cooperation can still be.  The confusion the instability of the last few weeks has created may mean the loss of thousands of Danish jobs over the somewhat longer term. 

Even though Danish interest and exchange rates have done relatively well during the currency crisis, the international economic recession that will certainly be a result of the instability will have huge consequences for Danish exports.

The driving force of the Danish economy is exports, and a setback for exports, therefore, has great consequences for the overall national economy, including especially employment.

It is frustrating that, despite many successful efforts to create a healthy economy in Denmark, our position is too weak with respect to, for example, the currency crisis in Europe.  A currency crisis due to the fact that other countries do not in similar ways keep order in their social housekeeping, and a monetary system that is apparently not yet equipped to ensure stability in the currency markets.
