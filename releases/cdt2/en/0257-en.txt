A news magazine discovered that Claudia Hamann-Vogt just two hours after the claimed high-risk birth in the parking lot was in her apartment.  At the same time, the magazine could demonstrate that the twins only existed in her imagination.  Were neither at the clinic in Wuppertal nor at any hospital in Munich, where according to her statement they were supposed to have been admitted with spastic paralysis. 

Then, the avalanche began.  Claudia Hamann-Vogt was arrested and interrogated 14 hours later.

For six hours, she stubbornly denied any knowledge of the kidnapping of any child.  Stuck to the lie about the twins.  Then, she broke down.

There are three things that seem to be able to cover over the motive.
