For being the most prominent hope in Danish rock music, they behave rather strangely.

Fielfraz have a special way of standing, when they are photographed.

They cross their legs, like musketeers cross blades.  And they insist on turning their feet inward, as if they had all been misoperated at the same hospital.  If anyone suggests that it looks idiotic, they just seem to turn their feet even further inward, until it presumably hurts.

Clearly, a band that possesses a blind faith in its own idiosyncrasy.  And will gladly grit their teeth to prove it.

The four Funen residents' totally unique sound, inspired by sixties' electric rock blasts on their debut "Shine" from 1990, got all the reviewers to act as if they had just received a pay hike.

Now their follow-up "Electric Eel" is out.  A record that demonstrates the extent to which you can drive rock on welfare assistance, blind faith and brotherhood.

Fielfraz is a bit off in its rock music pace, as well as in its defiant, boyish attitude.  And they know it very well themselves.
