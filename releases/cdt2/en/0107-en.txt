"I no longer believe there are any Market Committee members who can take in the whole context.  Nevertheless, we sit in meeting after meeting and give binding authority to ministers who are to represent Denmark's views in the EU Council of Ministers," says Duetoft.

Among other things, he refers to B.T.'s revelation of an EC Directive that, for reasons of public health, forbids private slaughterhouses from slaughtering more than 12 head of cattle a week.  Public health suffers no harm as long as fewer than 12 head of cattle are slaughtered.  If 13 head of cattle are slaughtered, the slaughterhouse must have the same advanced equipment as large export slaughterhouses.  And, thus, half the Danish slaughterhouses will be closed.

The Directive was ratified in July of this year.  However, the Market Committee did not discover its consequences until last week.

Duetoft sets out his controversial point of view in a new book on the European Unions, due out on Monday.  Peter Duetoft, who is a declared super-European and has a past in the European Parliament, has written the book together with Jens Peter Bonde from the People's Movement against the EC.
