Suzanne Swannie, Danish textile artist who, driven by pure lust for adventure, moved to Newfoundland 25 years ago has brought beautiful photographs home on her annual summer vacation with her mother, Bitten MÃ¸rch.  They are from her biggest decoration job to date for the new communications institute at Mount St. Vincent University at Halifax in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia.

It was the province's "art foundation", the Canadian Council, that gave her the job, since they were familiar with her works, her industrial design experience, decorating problems solved to date and sense of traditional local crafts.

Below the ceiling in the huge vestibule of the institute hovers Suzanne Swannie's six by two metre pyramidal space sculpture, which she really has conceived as a sort of encomium to the inventor of the telephone.

Alexander Graham Bell (1847-1922), who only 116 years ago invented the electric gab machine, the telephone, lived for many years in Halifax, and Suzanne Swannie found the inspiration for the sculpture in some of his working papers, among other things, sketches for kites and a component with an equilateral triangle designed as a pyramidal construction element.
