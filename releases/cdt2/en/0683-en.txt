Hans Otto Bisgaard has a way of dealing with becoming drowsy, when he is to go on the air with a direct TV programme.  If he can do it, he snatches a nap and is only awakened fifteen minutes before family Denmark settles down in front of the screen with coffee, cake and remote control within reach.

"But, most of all, I want to brush my teeth, just before we go on.  And if I don't do that, I can be pleased that there is a thick filter between TV viewers and me.  Actually, I experience some of my life's happiest moments during a direct TV broadcast, because there are no telephones to interfere with the rhythm," says the likeable television host, who has nerves of steel and warmth in his gaze, when the television cameras are running.

Tomorrow and for the following five Saturdays, Hans Otto Bisgaard will have his toothbrush on hand at DR's Studio 3, because he will be in the middle of the new direct entertainment programme "Rio Bio - Only for Ottomans".
