## Direct Objects ##

Direct objects ('dobj') also occur in constructions with object-control (see [control](http://copenhagen-dependency-treebank.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/#control)). Non-subject complements headed by "at" are usually analyzed as direct objects, but can also be predicatives (see our analysis of [at](http://copenhagen-dependency-treebank.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/nounsT.html#at-pronoun)).

Note that the reflexive object of socalled "inherently reflexive" verbs as well as "measure objects" are tagged as 'dobj', although these constructions do not allow passivization:

  * Han skyndte **sig**.
  * De skammer **sig**.
  * Den vejer **to kilo**.
  * Den koster **en hel herreg√•rd**.

In the Dutch treebank (CGN) these two types of objects are tagged with separate dependency labels (SE for obligatorily reflexive complement and ME for measure complements). The motivation for distinguishing these constructions from regular transitive constructions (with direct objects) is that they do not passivize. For us, passivizability is not a necessary criterion for being a direct object. Instead, we propose to tag reflexive complements and measure complements as 'dobj' and encode the lack of passivization (and the restrictions on what can function as 'dobj' with these verbs) in the lexical entry for the verb.
