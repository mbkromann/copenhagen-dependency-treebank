## Progressives ##

### Progressive ###

Progressive aspect is expressed syntactically, either by coordination (analyzed as standard coordination) or by "være" plus prepositional construction (analyzed as a predicative):

Alternatively, the preposition can be analyzed as a pobj to "være". The fact that we analyze other prepositional complements to copula verbs as pred, speaks in favor of the pred analysis. On the other hand, this is a construction where "være" would be said to be be used as an auxiliary verb, under theories that make such a distinction, whereas in predicative constructions "være" is used a main verb.

How do we capture that this is a specialized construction, including:

  * the prepositions cannot be exchanged for others?
  * the nobj for "i" must be one of the nouns "gang" or "færd"?
  * "ved" and "med" must take an "at" + infinitive complement?

Also, should the inifinitive share the subject of "være"? (Probably not)
