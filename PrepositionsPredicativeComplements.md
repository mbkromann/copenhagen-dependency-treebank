## Prepositions Predicative Complements ##

**Predicative complements** Predicative complements are found in so-called absolutive constructions, headed by the prepositions "med" or "under". The preposition takes a nominal object (nobj) and a predicative complement (pred), which may be a preposition, adjective or noun. Note that a nominal predicative complement is preceded by "som" (as), which we analyze as the head of the predicative complement.

  * **Uden Susan på holdet** taber vi
  * **Med halvdelen af holdet syge** taber vi
  * Vi taber **med ham som formand**

> Alternatively, the predicative complement could be analyzed as a dependent of the noun:

> However, this would be (one of the) only context where nouns could take predicative complements. In ordinary predicative constructions a verbal head is required:

  * Han er læge.
  * **Han læge.**

> There is a reading of "Uden Susan på holdet" where "på holdet" is a dependent of "Susan", but then it is a modifier, which helps establish the referent of Susan:

> The analysis of "som" as the head of the predicative complement carries over to the use of "som" + nominal as (adverbial) modifiers:

  * **Som formand** er han udemærket
  * Jeg kender ham ikke **som privatperson**.

> Is this a different "som"? Which means something like "qua"? If so, do we need to distinguish the two syntactically?
