## Imperatives ##

In **imperatives**, the subject is obligatorily absent (in the semantic interpretation, the subject is retrieved by coreference with the intended listener; thus, a [vocative](http://copenhagen-dependency-treebank.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/#voc) within an imperative always coincides with the subject, but only by coreference). All other complements of the verb are realized normally.
