## Interrogatives ##

Polar questions, including alternative questions, exhibit subject-verb inversion. The dependency structure, however, is identical to that of the corresponding declarative:

In wh-interrogatives the "wh"-word usually occupies the sentence-initial position, irrespective of its dependency role:

  * **Hvem** fandt cyklen?
  * **Hvad** fandt de?
  * **Hvordan/hvornår** fandt de cyklen?
  * **Hvor stor en andel** giver han os?
  * Han fandt **hvad**?

Again, the linear order has no effect on the dependency structure, which is identical to that of the corresponding declarative clauses. This holds true also in cases of 'long' extraction, where the governor for the wh-word belongs to an embedded clause (last example).

Note that "hvad" is also used to question verbal complements, but is still tagged as "dobj" in this case:

  * **Hvad** ville/kunne/må de? (De ville/kunne/må **synge**)

Embedded polar questions are headed by "om", which we analyze as a preposition that takes a verbal complement

Tag questions are adjuncts (mod) to the finite verb of the tagged clause. Note that the verb in the tag bears a filler dependency to an element of the matrix clause.

As an alternative one can analyze "om" as a conjunction, which is linked to the external governor (the finite verb of the matrix clause) by a special complement edge (or possibly as a dobj). Two facts speak in favor of the preposition analysis:

  * "spørge" can take other pobj's (eg, "Han spurgte **efter/til** kokken.")
  * "om" can also take nominal complements after "spørge" (eg, "Han spurgte om **tilladelse**").

If "om" in embedded polar questions is analyzed as a preposition the two constructions would receive a unified analysis.

A comment on the analysis of "hjem" as a modifier to "gik": alternatively "hjem" could be analyzed as a complement, either part or a locative-directional complement, if we decide to include such a dependency. This has no bearing on the analysis of interrogatives.
