## Vobj Vs Pred ##

**vobj or pred?** We have chosen to analyze uninflected perfect participles as verbal objects ('vobj') rather than subject-oriented predicatives ('pred'). The intuition behind the predicative analysis is that perfect participles are just like adjectives. The predicative analysis does have some advantages: it makes the analysis of perfect participles coherent with the analysis of copula constructions, explains why perfect participles have '-e' and '-n' inflected forms that closely resemble adjectives, and explains why perfect participles are so easily coordinated with adjectives (eg, "Han er vred og skuffet" ("He is angry and disappointed")). However, the predicative analysis also has some disadvantages: it gives a non-uniform analysis of perfect participles ('vobj' in "Han har spist" ("He has eaten"), but 'pred' in "Den er spist" ("It is eaten")), and does not seem to obey the usual number- and gender-agreement between subjects and predicatives (eg, "Mange **løsladt/løsladte/**god/gode mænd" ("Many released/good men") vs. "Mange mænd er løsladt/?løsladte/**god/gode" ("Many men are released/good")).**

One possible explanation is that perfect participles are genuinely ambiguous between being verbal objects and predicatives. However, we have been unable to find tests that would allow us to distinguish between these two alternative uses in practice. For this reason, we have chosen to always prefer the 'vobj' analysis over the 'pred' analysis, except when the participle is explicitly marked with the adjectival '-e' or '-n' inflections.

> These considerations also apply to examples like "få den stjålet" ("have it stolen (from you)"). Such an example might be analysed as an example of a resultative construction. But it is definately not resultative to the same degree as "gøre nogen glad" ("make somebody happy"). Besides rewording the predicative-like part ("den er stjålet" ("it is stolen"), "nogen er glad" ("somebody is happy")) reveals that following the considerations above, "stjålet" in "den er stjålet" should be analysed as a "vobj" to "er", not "pred", whereas "glad" in "nogen er glad" should be analysed as "pred".
