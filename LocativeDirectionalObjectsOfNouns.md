## Locative Directional Objects Of Nouns ##

A small class of common nouns allow a locative-directional object (lobj) to attach to them. Some have inherited this ability from the verb they are derived from, e.g. "en rejse" from "at rejse". Others simply carry this optional lobj as part of their meaning, e.g. "en tur" with the indication of starting and ending point by the prepositions "fra" and "til". The reason for using the label lobj instead of pobj is, that these "fra" and "til"'s always express a locative-directional meaning. Here is a (most likely unfinished) list of nouns taking an lobj, extracted from our tagged corpus (41 occurences):

  * rejse ("Rejsen **til** Berlin tager kun cirka 5 timer.")
  * tur ("Så tager vi en tur **i** tivoli!")
  * vej ("Vi er på vej **til** fest.")
  * gang ("Peter måtte gå den trælse gang **til** bistandkontoret.")
