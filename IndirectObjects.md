## Indirect Objects ##

We use "iobj" for indirect objects of ditransitive verbs.

  * Det har taget **mig** lang tid.
  * Det blev **forældrene** for meget.
  * Jeg købte **mig** en ny cykel.
  * Han er **mig** noget langsom.

Note that when this argument is expressed with a preposition ("Han viste den til hende") it is tagged as a prepositional object, and not as an indirect object.

An alternative is to tag also the prepositional expression of the beneficiary as "iobj". Our reason for not doing so is the principle that "iobj" and "dobj" are always nominal. Another alternative is to tag the prepositional expression as a modifier ("mod"). The main reason for not doing this is that the "til"-expression behaves more like a complement than a modifier. It is (almost) obligatory, it is ordered before any modifiers (modulo extraposition), and it seems to express the same semantic role as the "iobj", which is definitely a complement.
