## Syntactic Tests ##

In many cases, more than one analysis is possible. In that case, the following principles will be used to select the "best" analysis:

  * P1. Prefer analyses where governors are phonetically non-empty.
  * P2. Keep agreement as local as possible.
  * P3. Look at neighbouring languages (German, English, Swedish, etc.) for additional evidence.
  * P4. Prefer analyses where heads precede their dependents, if possible.

Here are some tests that should be considered when weighing two analyses against each other:

  * **deletion test:** delete some words and see what happens -- it tends to be impossible to delete a head without deleting the entire phrase.
  * **permutation test:** permute some of the words -- phrases tend to stick together, and only one complement phrase can be placed in the frontal field of a finite VP.
  * **agreement test:** agreement must be completely local, ie, directly between a dependent and its governor without any intervening nodes (unless they also agree by means of an explicit morphological marker).
  * **embedding test:** use the phrase as complement or adjunct of other phrases -- this will reveal whether it really is a phrase and help determine its word class.
  * **generation test:** what kind of phrases does the corresponding lexicon generate -- look for undergeneration and overgeneration.
  * **paradigm test:** examine the entire paradigm of words that can replace the word you are considering -- this may generate related constructions that may help you disambiguate between the choices.
  * **generalization test:** try to think of as many related constructions as possible, and make an analysis for all of them at the same time -- the analyses should be as similar as possible, and create as little ambiguity as possible in the hypothesized lexicon.
