## Type Shifting ##

There are many instances of words that clearly belong to one word class, but can be type shifted to another word class in certain circumstances. For example, given the right context, any adjective in Danish can be used as a noun (eg, as a subject, direct or indirect object, or nominal object), and some adjectives -- including words like "flere" ("more"), "ældre" ("older" = "the old people"), "unge" ("young" = "the young people"), and "gående" ("walking" = "walking people") have acquired an idiomatic use as nouns. In these cases, the PAROLE tag is preserved, but the word is allowed to take on a dependent role that is normally preserved for other word classes (eg, "subj" can be applied to adjectives that function as nouns).

Adjuncts license their adjunct governors in the lexicon, and act as functors to their adjunct governors during semantic interpretation -- ie, the lexical entry for the adjunct usually includes a description of the syntactic and semantic category of the governor. Thus, we could plausibly posit a type-shifting mechanism where an adjunct is allowed to pose externally as if it actually was the governor, ie, to take over the governor's word class and other syntactic properties externally (ie, when acting as a complement to other words), while keeping its own word class internally (ie, it still looks like the old original adjunct to its complements). The missing governor argument could be provided by a default (eg, "people"), or retrieved anaphorically from the context. Technically, this could be done by requiring a type-shifted adjunct to always generate an anaphoric filler, which is bound as filler object to the adjunct, and which requires a semantic antecedent in the (linguistic or non-linguistic) discourse during interpretation. This analysis is exemplified below, where the anaphoric filler generated by "grønne" has selected "æbler" as its antecedent:
