The purpose of this project is to create linguistically annotated text collections (treebanks) on the basis of the dependency-based grammar formalism Discontinuous Grammar. The treebanks created in the project can be used to train natural language parsers, syntax-based machine translation systems, and other statistically based natural language applications.

The project hosts the following treebanks:

  * the 100,000 word **Danish Dependency Treebank**, which was used as training material in the CoNLL shared task in 2006;
  * the 95,000 word **Copenhagen Danish-English Dependency Treebank**;
  * work-in-progress with respect to **Copenhagen Dependency Treebanks** for Danish, English, German, Italian, and Spanish.

The treebanks are released to the computational linguistics / natural language processing community under an open-source license (LGPL). For more information about the project, please visit our [CDT](CDT.md) page.
