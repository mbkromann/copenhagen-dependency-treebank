## Gapping ##

In gapping coordinations (such as "John loves coffee, and Mary tea"), the second conjunct has a phonetically empty head that may take the same complements and adjuncts as the first conjunct. In the treebank, where empty heads are not allowed, dependents of a phonetically empty head must be treated as special elliptic dependents of the governor of the elided head, indicated with edge label "&lt;''edge''&gt;". Some examples are shown below:

> The treebank analysis is a simplification of the analysis in Discontinuous Grammar, where the gap is represented by a filler node with a special "gap" dependency to the head of the ungapped conjunct, as shown below.
