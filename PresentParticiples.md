## Present Participles ##

In **present participles**, the subject is obligatorily absent (in the semantic interpretation, it is retrieved from the noun or verb that the present participle modifies). When the participle modifies a noun attributively, acts as a predicative, or modifies a verb while preceding another of the verbs complements, all of its noun complements must be absent or be realized as morphological complements (as in "den syngende cowboy"). In all other situations, noun complements are realized normally. Most other complements of the participle are realized normally in both cases. Only certain verbs allow the use of the present participle in predicative constructions.

Semantically, the present participle in "Hun fandt ham liggende" can modify either the subject or the object. In this respect, present participles are just like adjectival modifiers (eg, "nøgen" in "Lægen undersøgte patienten nøgen"). In the treebank analyses we have chosen not to include information about which participant adjectives or present participles modify, since it would make the manual annotation too complicated, and there is not always enough information in the corpus to decide this question.
