## Expletives ##

### Expletive subjects ###

Expletive subjects (labeled "expl") mostly occur with the word "der", but locative PPs and the place adverbial "her" is sometimes used as expletive subject as well. Any verb that does not have a direct object can undergo expletive shift -- that is, the subject of the verb is converted into a direct object (labeled "dobj") with the restriction that the new direct object must be indefinite, and a locative or temporal adverbial (usually "der") becomes the expletive subject (labeled "expl").

  * **Der** mangler en gaffel.
  * **Her** er tale om et klokkeklart mord.
  * **Der** er tilfaldet den ældste datter en stor pengesum.
  * **I en drøm** vil åbenbares Guds formål med dig, Johannes.

Verbal complements of the finite verb share the expletive subject via a [expl](expl.md) filler.

It is important to distinguish expletive subjects from fronted adverbials. In clauses with a complex verbal form, this is done by the position of the logical subject: if the logical subject immediately follows the finite verb (below left), the initial constituent is a modifier (mod) and the logical subject is subj. If the logical subject follows the right-most verbal form (below right), the adverbial is expl and the logical subject is dobj.

If there is only one verb, try inserting an auxiliary "vil". Alternatively, use the definiteness of the post-verbal nominal as a guide: if the post-copular nominal is definite (below left), it is the subject of a non-expletive construction (and the initial "der" is a modifier). If the post-copular nominal is indefinite (below right), it is a direct object of an expletive construction (and "der" is an expletive subject).

An alternative analysis is to tag the expletive as a regular subject (subj), but this analysis obscures the fact that the presence of the expletive subject affects the valency of the verb: it is only with expletive subjects that these verbs allow direct objects.

Another alternative is to analyze the transformed subject as a subject rather than a direct object. However, this fails to capture the fact that the post-verbal nominal in most respects behaves as a direct object and not as a subject: it is accusative (not nominative), it appears exactly in the position of direct objects, and it does not allow the presence of another direct object.
