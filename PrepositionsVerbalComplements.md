## Prepositions Verbal Complements ##

**Verbal complements** Finite clause complements without "at" are tagged as vobj:

  * uden de faldt
  * nÃ¥r han kommer
  * efter vi har spist

Anternatively, finite clauses without "at" could be analyzed as nobj, where the verbal head has undergone syntactic type-shifting to a nominal (in analogy with the analysis of certain uses of adjectives as type-shifted nouns). This would simplify the valency frame of prepositions by excluding vobj. On the other hand there does not appear to any independent evidence for type-shifting with finite clauses, as there could be said to be in the case of adjectives. And there are distributional constrasts between bare finite clauses and finite clauses with "at". For instance, bare finite clauses cannot occur in subject position, whereas clauses with "at" can:

  * De kommer**er vigtigt.
  ***At de kommer**er vigtigt.**

> If bare finite clauses are (type-shifted into) nominals, this contrast has to be encoded by specific selection restrictions on the subject. If bare finite clauses are verbal, it follows from the generalization that verbs cannot be subjects.
