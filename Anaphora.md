## Anaphora ##

In the treebank, an anaphoric reference between a pronoun and its antecedents can be indicated by a dependency that goes from the antecedent to the anaphoric element, labeled with "ref"; the dependency is usually drawn below the words. Anaphoric reference is currently only specified for purely syntactically determined anaphoric references, such as relative pronouns or wh-pronouns that refer to a relativized dependent within a relative clause. A few examples are shown below:

We have chosen not to specify anaphoric references in any other constructions. There are four reasons for this: (1) it would be too time-consuming to specify antecedents for all pronouns and definite noun phrases; (2) there are usually many possible antecedents for each pronoun, which leads to structural ambiguity, and human annotators often have difficulties agreeing on what is the "right" antecedent; (3) it is not clear that general anaphoric reference is a syntactic phenomenon -- for example, pronouns may refer to objects in the physical context that have not been introduced into the linguistic discourse, so perhaps anaphoric resolution is part of a general semantic reasoning process that involves both linguistic and non-linguistic information; (4) the specification of anaphoric references requires a theory of semantics, pragmatics and anaphoric reference, and we currently don't have such a theory.

The treebank analysis of relative clauses that contain a relative pronoun is a simplification of the analysis in Discontinuous Grammar. The main difference is that in DG, there is no direct "ref" dependency between the relative pronoun and the relativized noun. Instead, there is a filler licensed by the relative verb that acts as the complement of the relative pronoun, in analogy with the analysis of relative clauses without a relative pronoun. This is shown in the examples below:
