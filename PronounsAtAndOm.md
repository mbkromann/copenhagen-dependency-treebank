## Pronouns At And Om ##

### The words "at" and "om" ###

The words "at" and "om" are analyzed as special pronouns that take a verbal object, ie, in the external syntax, they are always analyzed as if they were ordinary noun phrases. "At" can take a finite or infinitive verb as its verbal object, whereas "om" only takes a finite verb as its verbal object. Also see our analysis of [it-clefts](http://copenhagen-dependency-treebank.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/verbsT.html#it-clefts) and [interrogative pronouns](http://copenhagen-dependency-treebank.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/verbsT.html#wh-pronoun).

"At" and "om" phrases may also be used as direct objects and nominal objects of prepositions:

If the phrase headed by "at" is a non-subject and the verbal complement of "at" is finite, then there often exists a parallel construction where "at" is omitted:

  * Marie fortæller os (at) hun inviterer os til Firenze.[[BR](BR.md)]''Marie tells us (that) she invites us to Firenze.''[[BR](BR.md)]
  * Marie ønsker ikke **(at) invitere os til Firenze.[[BR](BR.md)]''Marie wants not**(to) invite us to Firenze.''
  * ??(At) invitere os til Firenze ønsker Marie ikke.[[BR](BR.md)]''??(To) invite us to Firenze wants Marie not.''
  * **(At) vi mødes i morgen, er uheldigt.[[BR](BR.md)]''(**That) we meet tomorrow, is unfortunate.''

In this case, what would have been analyzed as the verbal object of "at", is analyzed as a verbal object of what would have been the governor of "at" (however, see also our analysis of [quotation](http://copenhagen-dependency-treebank.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/verbsT.html#quotation)):

![http://copenhagen-dependency-treebank.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/figs/at-none-01.png](http://copenhagen-dependency-treebank.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/figs/at-none-01.png) ![http://copenhagen-dependency-treebank.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/figs/at-none-02.png](http://copenhagen-dependency-treebank.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/figs/at-none-02.png) ![http://copenhagen-dependency-treebank.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/figs/at-none-03.png](http://copenhagen-dependency-treebank.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/figs/at-none-03.png)

The main reasons for analyzing "at" and "om" as pronouns are: (1) Phrases headed by "at" and "om" may function as subjects, whereas phrases headed by finite verbs, prepositions, or other so-called "complementizers" (eg, "hvis" ("if"), "når" ("when"), "fordi" ("because")) cannot function as subjects. (2) "at" and "om" phrases can be replaced with the pronoun "det" ("it"). (3) "at" and "om" phrases and noun phrases have nearly identical distribution, ie, whereever a noun phrase may appear, a phrase headed by "at" can usually appear instead if its semantics is compatible with the context, and conversely. Thus, "at han taler løber" ("that he speaks runs") is ill-formed, because an action cannot be the agent of a running event, whereas "at han kom i fængsel slog hans mor ihjel" ("that he went to prison killed his mother") is well-formed because it has a reasonable semantic interpretation (a certain event causing the mother's dead). (4) The alternative to our analysis is to analyze phrases headed by "om" and "at" as PPs or CPs, which forces us to say that subjects, direct objects and nominal objects of prepositions are not only NPs, but can be PPs and CPs as well, thus greatly expanding the number of valency frames for almost all verbs and prepositions, which is highly undesirable.

Many differences between "at" and "om" can be explained by the fact that "om" is an interrogative pronoun (like "hvem", "hvad", "hvornår", "hvorfor"), while "at" is non-interrogative. Verbs can either be indifferent wrt interrogativity, or place restrictions on the interrogativity of the noun complement: eg, "tror" ("think") and "mene" ("mean) require a non-interrogative noun complement, "spørge" ("ask") requires an interrogative noun complement, whereas "vide" ("know"), "se" ("see") and "høre" ("hear") allow both:

  * Jeg tror [han spiser|\*om han spiser|\*hvorfor han spiser](at.md).[[BR](BR.md)]''I think [he eats|\*whether he eats|\*why he eats](that.md).''
  * Jeg spørger [**at han spiser|om han spiser|hvorfor han spiser].[[BR](BR.md)]''I ask [**that he eats|whether he eats|why he eats].''
  * Jeg hører [han spiser|om han spiser|hvorfor han spiser](at.md).[[BR](BR.md)]''I hear [he eats|whether he eats|why he eats](that.md).''

The ODS claims that the Danish word "at" historically originates from two words: the demonstrative pronoun "?at" (like English "that") when used in constructions like "at"+sentence, and the preposition "ad" (like English "to", German "zu") when used in constructions like "at"+infinitive. ODS also states that the spelling "at" for both forms is very old and goes back at least to Old Norse, so the syncretism between the two forms into "at" happened at a very early stage in the development of Danish.

The examples below show "at" and "om" phrases appearing as subjects of predicatives and other verbs:

  * [Diskussionen|at diskutere bogen|at de diskuterede bogen|om de diskuterede bogen] var uinteressant.[[BR](BR.md)]''[discussion|to discuss the book|that they discussed the book|whether they discussed the book](The.md) was uninteresting.''
  * [Fejltagelsen|at tage sådan fejl|at jeg tog sådan fejl] gjorde mig mismodig.[[BR](BR.md)]''[mistake|to be so mistaken|that I was so mistaken](The.md) made me sad.''
  * [af hesten|at fodre hesten|at han fodrer hesten](Fodring.md) vil glæde ejeren.[[BR](BR.md)]''[of the horse|to feed the horse|that he feeds the horse](Feeding.md) will please the owner.''

The examples below show "at" and "om" phrases appearing as direct objects:

  * Kunne du tænke dig [hund|at købe en hund|at vi køber en hund](en.md)?[[BR](BR.md)]''Would you like [dog|to buy a dog|that we buy a dog](a.md)?''
  * Hun håbede (det bedste|at bestå eksamen|at han ville bestå eksamen).[[BR](BR.md)]''She hoped [best|to pass the exam|that she would pass the exam](the.md).''
  * Til fødselsdagen lovede hun dem (en bil|at køre bilen|at hun ville køre bilen).[[BR](BR.md)]''At the birthday, she promised them [car|to drive the car|that she would drive the car](a.md).''
  * Hun spurgte dem om de kunne bidrage.[[BR](BR.md)]''She asked them whether they could contribute.''

The examples below show "at" and "om" phrases appearing as nominal objects of prepositions:

  * Hun tænkte på [hus|at gå hjem|at hun ville gå hjem|om hun ville gå hjem](sit.md).[[BR](BR.md)]''She thought about [house|to go home|that she would go home|whether she would go home](her.md).''
  * håbet på [mirakel|at undslippe|at de ville undslippe|\*om de ville undslippe](et.md).[[BR](BR.md)]''The hope of [miracle|to escape|that they would escape|\*whether they would escape](a.md).''
  * Han spurgte om [kage|at få en kage|?at han ikke får kager nok|?om de ville give ham en kage](en.md).[[BR](BR.md)]''He asked about [cake|to get a cake|?that he not does get cakes enough|?whether they would give him a cake](a.md)''
  * Elefanten var træt af at blive skubbet til.[[BR](BR.md)]''Elephant-the was tired of to be pushed to.''
  * Hånden var ret våd og klam efter at være blevet spist af.[[BR](BR.md)]''Hand-the was rather wet and moist after to be been eaten of.''

In some examples it can be difficult to tell, whether "at" should attach to the adjectiv in the noun phrase or to the common noun. We believe that the following test may help:

  * "at" should be attached to the **adjective** if the phrase **allows** a predicative paraphrase, that is, if it is possible to say "N er A at...", with preservation of meaning. Example: "et rart gulv at gå på" -&gt; "gulvet er rart at gå på".
  * "at" should be attached to the **common noun** if the phrase **does not allow** a predicative paraphrase, that is, if it is not possible to say "N er A at...", with preservation of meaning. Example: "en sjov måde at gå på" -&gt; "**måden er sjov at gå på".**

**Analysis of "få + at + VP":** There seems to be two parallel expressions in the corpus: "Få noget at vide" and "Få at vide, at/om jeg kan fortsætte". The expressions being so parallel, we would like the analysis of them to be identical. The last one seems straightforward:

![http://copenhagen-dependency-treebank.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/figs/stine14.png](http://copenhagen-dependency-treebank.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/figs/stine14.png)

> A parallel analysis of the first would then look like this:

![http://copenhagen-dependency-treebank.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/figs/stine15.png](http://copenhagen-dependency-treebank.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/figs/stine15.png)

> The problem with this is, that normally we would analyse "noget" in "få noget" as dobj to "få". Besides, if we think that "noget" has moved forward in the sentence, because it is a "light" term, we will have other problems: usually "light" terms has the ''possibility'' to move forward, but it is an option, not a necessity. Here "noget" necessarily has to precede "at vide" - that "noget" should follow "at vide" is not an option. These two problems forces us to bring up another analysis. Another possible analysis would be a predicative analysis, where "at vide" would be pred to "få", while "noget" would be dobj to "få". This analysis still allows a parallel analysis of the first example:

**Rules for other constructions with "at":**

"At" can attach to both adjectives and nouns. If it is uncertain whether "at" attaches to the noun or the adjectiv in a particular noun phrase, we presented a guiding principle above. Usually though, there is not any problems determining what "at" attaches to, but rather what kind of attachment "at" represents. As a special kind of noun, "at" should be analysed as nobj, if "at" plays the role of an object in the sentence, and "at" should carry the label mod, if "at" is the head of a modifier. To tell wheter "at" in a certain construction should be analysed as nobj or mod, we have used the following principle:

  * If "at" attaches to an adjectiv, "at" should be analysed as nobj, if the adjectiv, in this construction, cannot be replaced with other adjectives, or only with a few other adjectives; "at" should be analysed as mod, if the adjectiv could be replaces by almost any other adjectiv. The same principle applies, if "at" attches to a noun: if the noun is generally replaceable, "at" is mod to the noun; if the noun is not generally replaceable, "at" is nobj to the noun.

> Here is a table with examples:

|  | Restricted Use (Not Generally Replaceable)[[BR](BR.md)] Nominal Object (nobj) | Non-Restricted Use (Generally Replaceable)[[BR](BR.md)] Modifier (mod) |
|:-|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Adjectiv** | 1) ?Det gjorde ondt at se på                                                  | 3) Den stol er vanskelig at flytte                                     |
| **Noun** | 2) Han fik det indtryk, at alt var godt                                       | 4) De fik en øl at drikke til maden                                    |

In our tagged corpus 2) and 3) are the most frequent examples, while 1) and 4) are very poorly represented with 1 and 3 occurences.

> This is our only example of 1) - and it is not a very good example for two reasons. First, the sentence is difficult to analyse because the "det" is ambiguous between being the subject of "gjorde" and being the complement of "på". Paraphrases show, though, that it must be the subject of "gjorde" only, since we can add a complement to "på": "Det gjorde ondt at se på Lars". Also, this "Lars" cannot replace the "det": "**Lars gjorde ondt at se på". It would therefore be wrong to add a filler from "på" to "det". Second, it is not clear whether the example is really an example of an it-cleft, as shown by the second graph. It seems that to be an example of an it-cleft, the "på" must have a complement: "**Det at se på gjorde ondt" vs. "Det at se på Lars gjorde ondt". It seems then, that the "på" acting as an adverb here forces us to choose the first analysis. The example, though a poor one, is still an example of Adjectiv + Nobj.
