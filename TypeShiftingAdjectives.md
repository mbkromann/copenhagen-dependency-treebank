## Type Shifting Adjectives ##

### Syntactic type-shifting to N ###

There are borderline cases where definite-marked adjectives may appear as subjects, such as:

  * (10) **Gode** er bedre end dårlige.
  * (11) **Gamle** er ikke velkomne.
  * (10a) God**er bedre end dårlig.
  ***Italiensk**er sværere end fransk.
  * Mit italienske har det dårligere end mit tyske.**

These constructions can be analyzed in at least two ways. One is to assume that some kind of ellipsis is taking place, so that "Gode" is understood as an elided form of "Nogle gode"/"Gode ting" (or whatever), where "gode" is an adjunct to the elided noun, and the elided noun is the head of the construction. This analysis has several disadvantages: the head of the construction is phonetically empty, which makes it hard to predict its presence and complicates parsing. Secondly, if the head noun can be elided, one needs to explain why the whole noun phrase cannot be elided, which would be difficult to encode syntactically.

Another possibility is to assume that e-inflected adjectives may typeshift to become nouns, in which case they will posit a phonetically empty pronoun corresponding to the elided noun in the other construction. Syntactically, the adjective is then the head of the construction, although the phonetically empty noun is the semantic head. In this way, we avoid the assumption that the noun phrase is headed by a phonetically empty constituent, which makes parsing a lot easier.
