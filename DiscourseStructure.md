## Discourse Structure ##

### Discourse structure ###

A discourse treebank should probably include at least the following discourse relations (which emerged in a conversation with Nicolas Asher):

  * **cause (explanation/result)**: the relationship between a cause and a result.
  * **narration**:
  * **background**: background information that sets the stage.
  * **elaboration**: elaboration of previous statement.
  * **commentary/quote**: quoting another statement
  * **questions (indirect question-answer)**:
    * **question-elaboration**: elaborating a question
  * **confirmation/agree/disagree**
  * **contrast/parallel**:
  * **concession**: acknowledging another point of view ("although")
  * **change of topic**
