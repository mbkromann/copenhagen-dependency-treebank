## Separator Markers ##

**Separator markers** (ie, "-") are always unary. In parenthetical appositions, the head modified by the appositional phrase licenses the first "-", whereas the second "-" is licensed by the head of the appositional phrase. Thus, "Hans" is the governor of the first "-" because it governs the head of the apposition ("at"); and as head of the apposition, "at" is the governor of the second "-".
