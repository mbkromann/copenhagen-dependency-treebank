#summary The DTAG treebank tool
#labels Draft

# Introduction #

DTAG is a versatile annotation tool that supports manual and
semi-automatic annotation of a wide range of linguistic phenomena,
including the annotation of syntax, discourse, coreference,
morphology, and word and phrase alignments. It includes commands
for editing general labeled graphs and graph alignments, comparing
annotations, managing annotation tasks, and interfacing with a
revision control system.  Its visualization component can display
graphs and alignments for entire texts in a compact format, with a
highly flexible and configurable formatting scheme. It also
provides a powerful search-replace mechanism with queries based on
full first-order logic, which can be used to search for linguistic
constructions and automatically apply graph transformations to
collections of annotated graphs.
