Dear Geert-Jan Kruijff,

I hope everything is going well. I am writing on behalf of the Nordic
Treebank Network (NTN), which has adapted TIGER-XML as its common
treebank representation format. Many network members are using the
"Annotate" tool to produce their treebanks. However, "Annotate" only
supports annotation of sentence-sized units, whereas a number of
people in the NTN are interested in also annotating discourse-sized
units that may span entire texts. 

We would therefore like to ask you whether Annotate is still being
actively developed, and if so, who we should contact if we want to
suggest changes to the program. If you will release Annotate under an
open-source license, some of our members have even expressed interest
in participating in the further development of Annotate -- something
which might relieve you of some of the maintenance costs for Annotate. 

Regards,
Matthias
