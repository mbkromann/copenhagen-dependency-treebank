Dear Matthias,

nice to hear TIGERSearch and TIGER-XML is being used.

Yes, we have plans to make TIGERSearch available under an open source 
license,
likely in summer. In consideration of the fact at the moment no developer is
exclusively working on TIGERSearch, we are occupied by fixing bugs 
(check out
the newest version 2.1.1 ;-).

One comment about your plans for extending TIGERSearch: it will be very 
difficult
to make edges across <s> segments queryable.

Regards,

Holger Voormann.
