<h3 align="center">Proposals for extensions and
	conventions in TIGER-XML<br>
	within the Nordic Treebank Network<br><br>
	March 23, 2005</h3>

<a name="1._Conventions"></a>
<h2>1. Conventions in TIGER-XML</h2>

	Proposals for conventions that govern the use of the existing
	TIGER-XML DTD. 

<blockquote>

<a name="__1.1_Encoding"></a>
<h3>1.1. Character encoding</h3>

	<p>Decide on a way of specifying the character encoding of the
	document (eg, iso-8859-1, utf-8, utf-16), so that XML parsers 
	know the correct character encoding when parsing the document
	(some XML parsers will die unexpectedly if the character encoding
	is not provided in the document).</p> 
	
	<blockquote><i>
		<p><b>NTN recommendation 1.1:</b>
		Always include XML tag like &lt;?xml version="1.0"
		encoding="iso-8859-1" standalone="yes"?&gt; in XML
		header, specifying the character encoding used in the document
		(iso-8859-1, utf8, etc.).</p>
	</i></blockquote>

<a name="__1.2_Intersegmental_links"></a>
<h3>1.2. Intersegmental links</h3>

   Decide on representation of intersegmental links (eg, links from an
   anaphor to an antecedent in an earlier sentence) in TIGER XML.
	<blockquote><i>
		<p><b>NTN recommendation 1.2:</b> Use secondary
		edges (but not primary edges) to refer to nodes outside the
		current &lt;s&gt; and &lt;graph&gt; tag. This solution
		respects the current TIGER-XML DTD. TIGERRegistry
		will currently ignore the edges and issue a warning, but 
		it will parse all other edges correctly. We must then 
		improve the TIGER tools so that they support these edges, and/or 
		create other tools that support them.</p>
	</i></blockquote>

<a name="__1.3_Glosses"></a>
<h3>1.3. Glosses</h3>

    Decide on a standard feature for encoding English glosses of the
	words in a treebank.
	<blockquote><i>
		<p><b>NTN recommendation 1.3:</b> Use the feature
		"gloss" to encode an English gloss in a &lt;t&gt; (terminal
		node) or &lt;nt&gt; (non-terminal node) tag. In non-terminal
		nodes, "gloss" is interpreted as a gloss of all terminals
		dominated by the node within the primary edge structure. 
	</i></blockquote>

<a name="__1.4_Dependency_graphs"></a>
<h3>1.4. Dependency graphs</h3>

	Decide on a standard way of representing dependency treebanks in
	TIGER XML so that dependency treebanks can be recreated from TIGER
	XML.
	<blockquote><i>
		<p><b>NTN recommendation 1.4.</b>: Encode all nodes in the
		dependency graph as two nodes in the TIGER graph: a terminal
		&lt;t&gt; and a non-terminal &lt;nt&gt; node, containing
		exactly the same feature and feature values and connected by a
		"--" primary edge. All edges in the dependency graph are
		represented as primary/secondary edges between the
		corresponding non-terminal nodes. Terminal nodes are not
		allowed to have any other edges than the "--" edge to their
		non-terminal parent node.</p>
		
		<p>When translating a TIGER graph back into a dependency
		graph, the terminal node and its corresponding non-terminal
		node should be merged back into one. If feature values in the
		two nodes conflict, terminal values should be preferred over
		non-terminal values.</p>
	</i></blockquote>

<a name="__1.5_Sources"></a>
<h3>1.5. External sources (text, speech, video)</h3>
	
	<p>Decide on a standard for associating a segment or a terminal or
	non-terminal node with an external source file, a time span, a
	byte span, and a speaker identifier.</p>

	<blockquote><em>
		<p><b>1.5a. Proposal by M.T. Kromann:</b> The following
		features can be used both in terminal &lt;t&gt; and
		non-terminal &lt;nt&gt; nodes:</p>
		<ul>
			<li> <b>speaker</b>: speaker identifier, encoded as an
				arbitrary string. 
			<li> <b>source</b>: external source URI, encoded either
				as an URL (eg, "http:..." or "file:...") or as a
				private URN (eg, "urn:private:..."). The dots "..."
				represent any string. Note: while "urn:..." follows
				the URI standard, "urn:private:..." does not since
				"private" isn't a registered URN.  However, no
				registered URN seems to fit.
			<li> <b>timespan</b>: time span, encoded as a real-valued
				segment, measured in seconds
				from the beginning of the external source. In text files, this
				feature can be used to encode the linear span of a
				text item, measured in terms of any abstract notion of
				time.
			<li> <b>bytespan</b>: byte span, encoded as an
				integer-valued segment, measured in bytes from the
				beginning of the external source. 
		</ul>
		A segment is encoded as a semicolon-separated list of intervals of
		the form "<i>first</i>-<i>last</i>". The notation
		"<i>number</i>" is used as a short-hand for an interval with
		identical first and last positions. For example, the
		string "1-3;59;89-91" represents an integer-valued segment, and
		"5.7-5.9;6.1-6.9" represents a real-valued segment.
	</em></blockquote>

<a name="__1.6_Semantics"></a>
<h3>1.6. Semantics (functor-argument structure)</h3>

	Decide on a standard way of representing functor-argument
	structure in TIGER XML.
	<blockquote><i>
		<p><b>NTN recommendation 1.6.</b> We recommend using one of
		two alternatives for the encoding of functor-argument
		structure:</p>

  		<ol>
			<li> If the functor of each argument can be identified
			uniquely from the syntactic structure alone (e.g. by being
			identical to the syntactic head in a dependency
			structure), argument roles should be encoded as attributes
			of the argument nodes.

			<li> If the functor of each argument cannot be identified
			uniquely from the syntactic structure alone (e.g. if one
			and the same node can be an argument of more than one
			functor), then functor-argument relations should be
			encoded using secondary edges from functors to arguments,
     		with argument roles as attributes of the secondary edges.
		</ol>

	  <p>Regardless of which alternative is chosen, we recommend that
	  all role labels begin with the symbol `@' (which is often used
	  for functional application in computational semantics) to
	  distinguish them from other types of attributes.</p>
	</i></blockquote>

</blockquote>

<a name="2._Extensions"></a>
<h2>2. Extensions to TIGER-XML</h2>

	Proposals for changes to the TIGER-XML DTD. 
	
<blockquote>

<a name="__2.1_Segments"></a>
<h3>2.1. Segments</h3>

	Decide on extension to TIGER XML for representing other kinds of
	segments than "s", including overlapping or discontinuous segments
	(eg, utterances, turns).

	<blockquote><i>
		<p><b>2.1a. Proposal by M.T. Kromann:</b> Use a 
		&lt;span id="..." next="..."&gt;...&lt;/span&gt; tag to indicate 
		a sequence of terminals. The &lt;span&gt; tag must occur
		within the &lt;terminals&gt; tag. To represent discontinuous
		spans that span several graphs, one can optionally use the
		"next" feature to encode the id of a following non-adjacent
		span that should be considered part of the current span. 
		To associate feature-value pairs with the span, the final span
		in a sequence is allowed to have an arbitrary number of
		associated feature-value pairs. In this representation, it is
		not possible to connect spans by means of edges.</p>
		
		<p>The TIGER tools currently ignore the proposed extra tags in
		the XML file, so the &lt;span&gt; tag will not cause the
		current TIGER tools to fail. We must then improve the TIGER
		tools so that they support these tags, and/or create other
		tools that support them.</p>
	</i></blockquote>

<a name="__2.2_Alignment"></a>
<h3>2.2. Parallel alignment</h3>

	Decide on a standard method for representing parallel aligned
	treebanks in TIGER-XML.

	<blockquote><i>
		<p><b>2.2a. Proposal by Martin Volk and Yvonne Samuelsson:</b>

		Use the liu-align.dtd from Linköping University. The
		alignment file consists of: 
		<ul>
			<li> <b>&lt;align&gt;</b><br> = declares the source and target file
			<li> <b>&lt;linkList&gt;</b><br> = groups the list of links
			<li> <b>&lt;sentLink&gt;</b><br> = groups the links per translation
				unit pair (usually sentence pair, but sometimes 1-n or
				n-1 alignments) with the attribute 'xtargets'
				specifying the numbers of the sentences involved.
			<li> <b>&lt;phraseLink&gt;</b><br> = the individual links with the
				attribute 'xtargets' specifying alignments from
				'sentence number _ phrase number' in  language 1 to
				'sentence number _ phrase number' in  language 2.
		</ul>
		Here is an <a href="align-xml.xml">example alignment</a>.
		The one thing that we do not like about our approach is the
		fact that if a sentence's annotation is modified, then the
		node numbers might change and there is no easy way to see what
		has changed. So if there is another solution that solves this
		problem, we will be very interested.</p></p>

		<li><b>2.2b. Proposal by M.T. Kromann:</b> Like Martin and
		Yvonne, I am not completely happy with my proposal, which is
		mostly stated here for the comparison. The following tags are
		used:
		<ul>
			<li> <b>&lt;DTAGalign&gt;</b><br>= specify alignment.
			<li> <b>&lt;alignFile key="a" href="file:../ddt-done/0001.tag"
			sign="_input"/&gt;</b><br>= specify alignment file for a given
			key, and the attribute used as signature (see below).

			<li> <b>&lt;align out="a43 a44 a47" type="fix" in="b0 b2" creator="-1"
			outsign="vil ikke have" insign="won't have"/&gt;</b><br>
			= specify alignment edge
			connecting nodes in the two graphs, with the given input
			and output signature and creator
		</ul>
		The alignment may contain an arbitrary number of aligned
		texts (not just two). The creator is an integer representing a
		user id where -100 is interpreted as an unconfirmed
		automatically created edge, and -n with n&lt;100 is
		interpreted as an automatic edge that has been confirmed n
		times. The problem with additions/deletions in the aligned
		graphs (and hence changed id's) reported by Martin and Yvonne
		is solved by specifying a signature for the outgoing and
		incoming nodes on the edge, ie, the values of a certain
		attribute -- which should be sufficient to create an automatic
		realignment after most additions/deletions.  Here is <a
		href="example.atag">an example alignment</a>.
