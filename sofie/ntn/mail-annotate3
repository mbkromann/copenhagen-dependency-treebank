Dear Geert-Jan,

Thanks for your very detailed reply -- I will pass it on to the
network. Your new version of Annotate certainly sounds very
interesting, I am sure it will address the concerns of our members.
We will be looking forward to the Java version in May (or whenever). 
We will also look into your proposed method of doing discourse
annotation -- it may well satisfy our needs. Thanks again for all your
help -- I really appreciate it.

Regards,
Matthias
