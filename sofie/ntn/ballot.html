<h1 align="center">Ballot for TIGER-XML working group</h1>

<h2>Choices</h2>

For each proposal, you must select the course of action that you think is
most appropriate by putting an "x" in the appropriate column:
<ul>
	<li> <b>Turn into recommendation</b>: the NTN should turn the
		proposal into a recommendation as it is.
	<li> <b>Set down working group</b>: the NTN should set down a
		working group that will make a new recommendation based on this
		proposal (possibly combining it with other proposals as well);
		the new recommendation will be
		submitted to a second round of voting.
	<li> <b>No action</b>: the NTN cannot realistically make
		a recommendation that will suit a large number of NTN members,
		within the limited timespan of the network.
</ul>
Within each area, you can only select the option "Turn into
recommendation" for at most one proposal.
