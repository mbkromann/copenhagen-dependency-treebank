Subject: The "Annotate" tool

Dear Geert-Jan Kruijff,

I hope everything is going well. I am writing on behalf of the Nordic
Treebank Network (NTN), which has adapted TIGER-XML as its common
treebank representation format. Many network members are using the
"Annotate" tool to produce their treebanks. However, "Annotate" only
supports annotation of sentence-sized units, whereas a number of
people in the NTN are interested in also annotating discourse-sized
units that may span entire texts. 

We would therefore like to ask you whether Annotate is still being
actively developed, and if so, who we should contact if we want to
suggest changes to the program. If you will release Annotate under an
open-source license, some of our members have even expressed interest
in participating in the further development of Annotate -- something
which might relieve you of some of the maintenance costs for Annotate. 

Regards,
Matthias

Hallo Matthias!

Thanks for asking :-) Busy as usual, as usual.

... correct ...

... which is interesting!

Well, no and yes.

No: We no longer do any active development on the Tcl/Tk-based version 
of Annotate. It requires libraries that are no longer broadly 
supported, which has led to problems installing Annotate.

But ...

Yes: We are developing a new version of Annotate, programmed solely in 
Java. The new Annotate is based on a plug-and-play architecture (using 
RMI), enabling a user to plug in his/her own components and specifying 
a personalized workflow that defines the information flow between 
different (available) components.

Well. Students of mine are working on the new Java-based Annotate; I 
hope that we'll have a beta-version by May, but it remains to be seen 
whether that's overly optimistic or not. The beta-version should 
include:

* the GUI with complete edit-facilities as familiar from the old 
Annotate;
* wrappers for the components that came with the old Annotate (TnT for 
PoS-tagging, Cascaded MMs for partial parsing)
* a GUI for the workflow manager that let's you specify the information 
flow between different components
* a DB-XML-based setup for creating and maintaining treebanks, as one 
possibility; if you want to use MySQL, that's of course fine -- we'd 
like to offer a completely platform-independent solution.

Most of this should come as an Open Source API (perhaps aside from some 
of the Java code we got from TigerSearch). That should enable others to 
extend the API, correct it, etc :-)

With this plug-and-play setup, you should be able to plug in your own 
tools for discourse annotation, of course.

Having said that, we HAVE been doing discourse-level annotation as 
well, but approached it the way that we use a whole suite of tools 
rather than just one complex one. As long as the tools create XML 
annotation, and we have a way to relate these annotations in a 
stand-off encoding way, we can still obtain an integrated picture. In 
this way we've been annotation TIGER and the WSJ with linguistic 
information related to information structure: prosody (using EMU), 
syntactic phenomena (TIGER/XML Spy), discourse-level phenomena (EML 
Heidelberg's MMAX). Some papers are coming out now at a workshop at 
HLT-NAACL, and at LREC.

Hope this helps,
Cheers,

GJ

Dear Geert-Jan,

Thanks for your very detailed reply -- I will pass it on to the
network. Your new version of Annotate certainly sounds very
interesting, I am sure it will address the concerns of our members.
We will be looking forward to the Java version in May (or whenever). 
We will also look into your proposed method of doing discourse
annotation -- it may well satisfy our needs. Thanks again for all your
help -- I really appreciate it.

Regards,
Matthias
