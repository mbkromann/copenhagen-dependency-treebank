Dear TIGER developers,

I am writing to you on behalf of the Nordic Treebank Network. In the
network, we have adopted TIGER-XML as our common treebank
representation format and produced tools for converting our various
treebanks into TIGER-XML (including treebanks for Danish, Estonian,
Finnish, German, Norwegian, and Swedish). 

We are very happy with TIGER-XML and the TIGER tools -- we think they
are great work. However, since they do not address all the needs
within the network, we have begun discussing how to extend TIGER-XML
and the TIGER tools in various ways, and how to standardize our
use of the existing TIGER-XML DTD. 

The changes and conventions that we have discussed concern:

	Conventions for using the existing TIGER-XML DTD:
		* standardized encoding of dependency graphs
		* standardized encoding of links to external text, sound or
		  video files
		* standardized encoding of speaker identity and time span
		* standardized encoding of functor-argument structure

	Extensions to the existing TIGER-XML DTD:
		* encoding generalized segmentation (eg, overlapping or
		  discontinuous segments used for encoding utterances
		  and turns in spoken language)
		* encoding parallel alignment in parallel treebanks

	Extensions to the existing TIGER tools:
		* visualizing secondary edges between non-terminals across <s>
		  segments (in order to encode discourse treebanks)
		* visualizing generalized segmentation
		* command-line search in order to use TIGERSearch for web
		  interfaces

The problems and the proposals I have received so far from the
network are described in more detail on the web page
http://www.id.cbs.dk/~mtk/ntn/tiger-xml.html. 

I am writing to you both because you might view our proposals as
valuable feedback, and also because we would very much like to
coordinate our proposals with you before we proceed. Perhaps you even
have some good ideas for solving some of the problems that we are
looking at. 

I would therefore like to ask you the following questions: (1) Have
you thought about some of the problems we are considering, and if so,
what kind of solution do you recommend? (2) Are you interested in
feedback from us with respect to future changes to TIGER-XML and the
TIGER tools? (3) Are you still actively developing the TIGER tools,
and do you plan to make extensions to the tools in the future that may
address our needs? (4) If not, some of our network members have
expressed interest in trying to extend the TIGER tools themselves.
Would you consider opening up the development of the TIGER tools to
outside groups by making the tools available under an open source
license (which might allow you to share the cost of maintaining the
TIGER tools with other groups)? 

Regards,
Matthias
