TOOLS AND RESOURCES:

9:10	Eckhard:

		very few problems:
		but some disadvantages:
			strict consistency checks: 
			no command-line: TIGER cannot be used on internet
			alternative search tool: tgrep2 for Penn treebank format
			visl2penn: conversion to tgrep2 compiler
		Martin: use XML parser for consistency checking

9:32	Joakim:

			encoding dependency/constituency
			annoyance: problem with drawing PSG dependency graphs

		Martin: search -- any problems? JN: not looked into it.


9:50	Jens:

			different corpora

			spoken language treebank:
				* basic unit: utterance rather than turn
			problems:
				+crossing branches
				?short utterances
				+own communication management
				?interactive dependency
				multimodality
				context dependency
			relation between utterances:
				1. coreference
				2. phrase-structure, sentential functions, dependence,
					predication across utterances
				3. Pragmatic functional dependence
					question-answer
					statement-feedback

		Koenrad:
			carefully consider what is possible: concentrate on syntax
			syntactic phenomena in speech
				repairs

				jeg jobbede de første tre år jeg jobbede hos centra

10:15	Matthias:

11:05	Martin:
			Annotate: 

11:25	Sofia:
			* doesn't believe in strict distinction between speech and
			  written language
			* doesn't believe in just annotating syntactic structure;
			  should annotate discourse information

			* Discourse information - what is it?
				a) referential connections: anaphora (all kinds)
				b) connective bindings: discourse relations (eg, RST)

			* Discourse treebanks (DRT Marcu, Penn Discourse Treebanks)

				
Matthias:
	* why bring up discourse in NTN? 
		- need for discourse relations: MT, coherent generation
		- people are starting to work on it
		- convergence: interface between syntax and discourse
		- proactive role

	* NTN: standard for encoding discourse
	
General discussion:

		- Jens: Is TIGER XML a good common discourse format?
		- Jens: Work on 1-2 constructions in spoken language?
		- Joakim: Include discussion of semantic treebanks.
