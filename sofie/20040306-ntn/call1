Subject: [NTN]Call for presentations in the "Tools and Resources" session

Dear NTN members,

The "Tools and resources" session on March 6 is devoted to the
presentation of completed work with TIGER-XML or other possible
candidates for a common representation format. We therefore ask you
to register a presentation at the "Tools and resources" session if you
have:

	(a) posted a treebank in TIGER-XML format to the nordic-treebank
	mailing list and/or to Lars Nygaard's web interface to the Sofie
	corpus; or
=09
	(b) created a tool that can be used to process arbitrary treebanks
	in TIGER-XML format, such as Lars Nygaard's web interface (the
	tool must be completed work); or=20

	(c) posted a treebank to the nordic-treebank mailing list in a
	well-documented format other than TIGER-XML, provided the format
	is of general interest and can be argued to solve inherent
	problems in TIGER-XML.

The presentations will be approximately 20-30 minutes (including time
for discussion), depending on the number of speakers. In your
presentation, we suggest that you focus on:

	* Experiences with conversion to TIGER-XML: What changes in
	  linguistic representations were necessary in order to make your
	  treebank encodable in TIGER-XML?=20
	 =20
	* Proposals for changes to TIGER-XML: Did you discover any
	  undesirable limitations in TIGER-XML or the TIGER tools? Do you
	  have concrete proposals for extending TIGER-XML or the
	  associated tools so that the problems can be solved?
	  Do you think the "Tools and resources" working group should=20
	  provide feedback and recommendations to the TIGER team about
	  desirable extensions of the TIGER tools?=20

	* Tools for using treebanks encoded in TIGER-XML: Describe any
	  tools you have created in order to use arbitrary treebanks
	  created in TIGER-XML, or describe innovative uses of existing
	  tools.=20

	* Experiences with other formats: Do you have concrete experiences=20
	  with other commonly known and well-documented representation
	  formats that are better suited in the long-term for representing
	  all the kinds of treebanks envisaged within the NTN (including
	  treebanks for spoken language, discourse, and semantics)?

In order to register, please send an email to Matthias Trautner
Kromann <mtk@id.cbs.dk> with the title of the talk. Registration
deadline: Friday, February 27.

Regards,
Matthias Trautner Kromann

Subject: [NTN]Call for presentations in the "Parallel treebanks" session

Dear NTN members,

The "Parallel treebanks" session on March 6 is devoted to the
presentation of completed work with treebanks. We therefore ask you
to register a presentation at the "Parallel treebanks" session if you
have:

	posted a treebank in to the nordic-treebank
	mailing list and/or to Lars Nygaard's web interface to the Sofie
	corpus


The presentations will be approximately 15-30 minutes (including time
for discussion), depending on the number of speakers. In your
presentation, we suggest that you focus on and/or think about

1) Your particular choice of linguistic terminology
2) where to find this terminology
3) what kind of linguistic tools have been used (tagger, parser, 
parse selection, manual?)
4) interesting linguistc examples (PPs, PP attachment, clefts etc.)
5) using each other's analysis for the other languages
6) whether to choose the same terminology
7) parallel spoken language treebank?

The first three points are clearly something that the participants 
who have provided a treebank ought to say something about. The rest 
of the points are discussion points where everybody should feel free 
to say something and take part in a discussion.

In order to register your talk, please send an email to Janne Bondi 
Johannessen <jannebj@ilf.uio.no> with the title of the talk. 
Registration
deadline: Friday, February 27.

Looking forwrd to hearing from you!
Janne.

Subject: [NTN]Dependency annotation of Danish Sofie corpus

Dear NTN members,

I have annotated the first 103 sentences in the Danish Sofie corpus,
using the dependency annotation scheme used in the Danish Dependency
Treebank, and converted it to TIGER XML. I have attached the following
two files:

	sofie-ddt-1.0.xml: annotations in TIGER XML format
	sofie-ddt-1.0.tag: annotations in original DTAG format
		(http://www.id.cbs.dk/~mtk/dtag)

The dependency graphs have been encoded as phrase structure graphs in
TIGER XML, ie, word nodes in the dependency graph have been expanded
into two nodes: a terminal node and a non-terminal node, both having
the same features. By playing around with the display options in
TIGERSearch, you can select which one of the following three features
you want the phrasal nodes to display:

	word =3D the word (default)
	cat =3D the abbreviated morpho-syntactic PAROLE description of the
		head word in the phrase
	msd =3D the full morpho-syntactic PAROLE description of the
		head word in the phrase

Regards,
Matthias
