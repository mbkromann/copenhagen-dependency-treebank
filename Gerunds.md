## Gerunds ##

**Gerunds** behave like nouns in the external syntax and should be tagged as such. In the internal syntax, they are still verbs and can take prepositional objects and (slightly more unusually) nominal objects in accordance with the verb's valency frame. Subjects are never realized in gerunds, and even though the subject coincides with the possessor in a possessive, the gerund is still marked as a "possd" complement of the possessor, with no explicit subject filler between the possessor and the verb.
