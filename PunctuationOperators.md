## Punctuation Operators ##

**Operators** are symbolic abbreviations for other words (usually arithmetic and logical operators), and are pronounced as the word they abbreviate when read aloud; they are not necessarily analyzed in the same way, though. **Unary operators** (eg, negation of numbers) take a single argument, whereas **binary operators** (eg, plus) take two arguments. Unary operators are analyzed as adjuncts of the argument they modify, binary operators are analyzed like coordination: ie, the first conjunct is the head, the operator is a coordinator, and the second conjunct is a complement of the operator. Some examples of sentences with operators, and their corresponding unabbreviated form and dependency graph, are shown below:

  * Han fik &gt; 300% ud af det. [[BR](BR.md)]''Han fik mere end 300 procent ud af det.''
