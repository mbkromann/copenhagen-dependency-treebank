## Punctuation Rules ##

The most important licensing conditions for punctuation signs are stated below:

  * **utterances [.?!]**: an utterance (ie, the head of an entire sentence whose first word is capitalized) licenses a sentence-final ".", "?", or "!".
  * **after sentences [,]**: a finite verb with a subject licenses a comma at its right boundary.
  * **before sentences (old system) [,]**: any verb (and any relativized noun except for wh-pronouns, and any preposition that is the complement of a verb or noun) which has a landed node that contains a sentence (via a chain of prepositions, wh-pronouns, "at"-pronouns, or subordinating conjunctions, without any intervening comma), licenses a comma before the landed node.
  * **long topicalizations (old pause system) [,]**: if a topicalized, sentence-initial phrase is very long, the head of the topicalized phrase licenses a comma at its right boundary.
  * **adjectives in NPs [,]**: a noun licenses a comma between non-intersective adjectival modifiers, but no comma between intersective adjectival modifiers.
  * **parentheticals [,-()]:** the head word in a parenthetical phrase licenses a comma (or: hyphen, parenthesis) at the end of the parenthetical (and a parenthesis in the beginning, if there is a matching right parenthesis); the governor of the parenthetical head licenses a comma (or: hyphen) at the beginning of the parenthetical.
  * **coordination [,;-()]**: the first conjunct licenses a comma between all conjuncts that are not separated by a coordinator (or semi-colon, if each conjunct is a sentence or a coordinated structure; or parentheses or dash, if there are two conjuncts and the second is parenthetical). If the first conjunct is a sentence, it licenses a comma before all conjuncts, regardless of whether they are headed by a coordinator or not.
  * **speaker change [-]**: when the discourse changes to a new speaker, the head of the new speaker's first utterance licenses a sentence-initial dash "-".
  * **pauses [-...]**: any word can license a speech pause (indicated by dash "-" or dots "..."); the dash or dots is then analyzed as a dependent of the highest possible landing site to the left.
  * **quotes ["..." '...']**: a head will license quotes around any continuous sequence of landed nodes.
