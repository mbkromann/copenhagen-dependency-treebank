## Phonetically Empty Heads ##

**Phonetically empty heads:** DP and NP analyses sometimes assume that, in the absence of a pronoun or common noun, we should posit a phonetically empty governor so that all noun phrases are headed by a pronoun (or common noun), even when no pronoun (common noun) is present in the input. However, there is no compelling reason why noun phrases should be headed by only one kind of noun, and phonetically empty governors greatly complicate the parsing task because they can be built without any evidence for them in the input. We therefore follow our theoretical principle P1 to avoid phonetically empty heads, by preferring the analysis where noun phrases can be headed by all kinds of nouns, as well as adjectives (after appropriate type-shifting).
