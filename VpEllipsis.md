## Vp Ellipsis ##

VP ellipsis is typically realized as VP anaphora, with the proform "det". The proform is tagged as a dobj to the verb:

An alternative is to analyze "det" as a (special type of) vobj. The dobj analysis seems better in so far as it is compatible with "det" being simply a personal pronoun. On the other hand, the vobj analysis reflects the fact that the antecedent for the proform is verbal.

VPE constructions without proforms are analyzed in terms of [vobj](vobj.md) fillers also needs to be compatible with the existence of VPE without proforms:

  * Marie kan synge rent, men Susan kan ikke.
  * Vi besøgte de byer (som) I gjorde.

> The last example involves antecedent contained deletion, and that here the proform is impossible: **Vi besøgte de byer (som) I gjorde**det**.**
