## Adjectival Attachment ##

**Adjectival attachment:** In most linguistic theories, adjectives are analyzed as dependents of the common noun rather than the pronoun. WG analyzes adjectives as dependents of both the pronoun and the noun. Our choice is to analyze adjectives as adjuncts to pronouns, if present, for the following reasons: (1) In Danish, adjectives agree with the form of their pronoun ("den røde hest" vs. "en rød hest"), although the common noun is not morphologically marked for the form of the pronoun. Similarly, in German, the adjective agrees with the pronoun wrt the strong-weak-einiger inflection ("ein guter Mann" vs. "der gute Mann"), although the common noun is not morphologically marked for the form of the pronoun. (2) In German, adjectives agree with their pronoun wrt case marking ("ein guter Mann" vs. "einem guten Mann"), although the common noun is not marked for case. (3) In Swedish, it is possible to say "den goda mannen" ("the good man-the"), but not "**goda mannen" ("good man-the") -- ie, an adjective can act as a modifier in the presence of a pronoun, but not in the presence of a definite-marked common noun alone (an observation due to Joakim Nivre). (4) If we want to avoid phonetically empty heads, we are forced to analyze adjectives as modifiers of the pronoun in "de røde" ("the red") and as modifiers of the common noun in "røde heste" ("red horses") or "rødt kød" ("red meat"); thus, in our analysis, "de røde heste" is analogous to "de røde" rather than "røde heste", whereas "de røde heste" is analogous to "røde heste" rather than "de røde" in the traditional analysis, so our analysis and the traditional analysis are equally good wrt structural similarity to other noun phrases. (5) According to our theoretical preference P3, we should prefer analyses where heads precede their dependents, everything else being equal.**

An adjectival phrase can normally be used predicatively, so we can test whether a group of adjectives used attributively constitute one phrase or not by examining the corresponding predicative construction, which allows only one adjectival phrase (a test proposed to us by Richard Hudson):

  * en stor og hvid hest (''A big and white horse'')[[BR](BR.md)] --&gt; Hesten er stor og hvid. (''The horse is big and white'')
  * en stor hvid hest (''A big white horse'')[[BR](BR.md)] --&gt; **Hesten er stor hvid. (''**The horse is big white''.)

Usually, groups of attributive adjectival phrases only constitute a single phrase in coordinated constructions, where there must be an explicit coordinator like "og" ("and") or "eller" ("or").
